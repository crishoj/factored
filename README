Makefile-based pipeline for factored MT experiments

OBJECTIVE

    Let GNU's make handle the dependency chain for
    constructing and runnings experiments on factored MT corpora,
    including updating files when their dependencies have been
    updated with newer versions, as well as taking care of
    which subprocesses may be run in parallel.
