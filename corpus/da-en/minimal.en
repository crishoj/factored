resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 17 december 1999 , and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .
although , as you will have seen , the dreaded ' millennium bug ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .
please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
madam president , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka .
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam , who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago .
yes , mr evans , i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
if the house agrees , i shall do as mr evans has suggested .
madam president , on a point of order .
i would like your advice about rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .
the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday .
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
at the request of a french member , mr zimeray , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
thank you , mr segni , i shall do so gladly .
indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted .
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest .
it is the case of alexander nikitin .
all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
yes , mrs schroedter , i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter .
but , madam president , my personal request has not been met .
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .
mrs plooij-van gorsel , i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors ' meeting on wednesday .
it will , i hope , be examined in a positive light .
madam president , can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?
why has there been no fire drill , either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings ?
why are there no fire instructions ?
why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?
why are no-smoking areas not enforced ? it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
mrs lynne , you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done .
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors , and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
madam president , mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vice-president , mrs de palacio , which appeared in a spanish newspaper .
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .
i would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the abc newspaper on 18 november .
mr berenguer fuster , we shall check all this .
i admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
so parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo .
as people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .
there is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what is happening .
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday .
agenda
this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
i would also like to point out , madam president , that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature .
it did so again during this legislature , in july , and then , in september , it voted once more to approve the whole commission .
there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
to this end , i would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 september , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
either the commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .
alternatively , parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .
therefore , madam president , i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( applause from the pse group )
madam president , i really am quite astonished at mr barón crespo ' s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on wednesday 's agenda .
mr barón crespo , you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday .
i am not criticising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
mr hänsch represented you on this occasion .
in the conference of presidents , we had an in-depth discussion .
your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members .
there was a vote on this matter .
as i recall , the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions .
all of the others were of a different opinion .
that was the decision .
i should now like to comment on the issue itself .
we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission .
there is no such document !
the commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in february .
we have said , very well , if the commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as january then we will do it in february .
we have agreed to this .
after all , we do not wish to quarrel with the commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path .
however , we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the commission .
i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our groups .
you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content .
the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group .
( applause from the ppe-de group )
madam president , i would like to make it very clear that , above all , the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and , amongst those , the decision establishing its agenda .
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .
madam president , i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission ' s legislative programme .
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated .
( parliament rejected the request ) president .
still on the subject of wednesday ' s sitting , i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
the ppe-de group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?
i do not know whether this information is correct , but the ppe-de group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
thank you , mr poettering .
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request .
madam president , i would firstly like to point out mr poettering ' s lack of logic .
it is not a lot to ask .
we shall proceed to vote on the ppe-de group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
madam president , i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
madam president , has my vote been counted ? i was unable to vote electronically , since i do not have a card .
my vote was " in favour " .
indeed , if we add the two members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
madam president , the presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
there is no room for amendments .
that did not happen .
i would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group .
this is an important matter. it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
madam president , i do not wish to reopen the debate , but i had also asked for the floor , to comment on mr barón crespo 's motion .
you did not call me either .
i regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
i am terribly sorry , mr hänsch and mr cox .
i did not see you asking to speak .
even so , i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes .
when we adopt the minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
this seems to me to be a workable solution .
of course , the minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes .
mr cox , mr hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
madam president , if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not , and cannot , object to that .
if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote , i accept that but with reservations .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( the order of business was adopted thus amended )
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
our amendments from the first reading have , i believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which i would urge you to support .
i would urge you to endorse this .
the renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of europe .
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit .
in fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
madam president , first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .
i congratulate him on his excellent report .
my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible .
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
madam president , i would like to make a few comments .
i would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the commission for the proposal it has submitted .
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
this is a pity , in a sense .
this is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
furthermore , it has transpired that research in the ports in belgium , finland , but also in japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
in short , the issue is an important one .
if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 january of this year .
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
it is therefore also being requested that iso 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
the work is done. all that remains is the business of enforcement .
i would like to mention one final point .
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
madam president , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so .
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
i should like to make just a few comments .
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 19 march 1998 , even though parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
this is not just the fault of the commission , but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
in principle , i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .
however , when it comes to safety , i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .
i can live with these minimum standards , but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
my third point has also been mentioned already .
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries .
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
very briefly , i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .
as mr simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
finally , i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission .
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , mr koch .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
transport of dangerous goods by road
delays in the cen ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
in this respect , i accept this proposal to amend directive 94 / 55 / ec which has been tabled for discussion today .
the amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community .
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the member states obtain more powers .
the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own .
in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 1999 .
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºc .
this is in the special interest of northern european regions .
i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but i would ask you to endorse this report .
mr president , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
i am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .
i would like to briefly comment on the commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
the commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .
consequently , i have tabled some amendments to mr koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
my amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
according to the commission ' s proposal -20ºc would have been sufficient .
on the shores of the mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
there is support for the eu in lapland also , so let us remember them .
i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºc .
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .
mr president , with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
i thought that it was quite superb .
this directive is a contribution to this .
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .
mr president , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu , both on roads and railways and by sea .
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .
in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states .
this is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , mr koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament , mr ari vatanen .
in many ways , the prerequisites differ from one member state to another .
by approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union .
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment .
the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .
for one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .
if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at ?
mr president , i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours .
a moment ago , mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
lastly , mr president , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out .
the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , mr koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
structural funds - cohesion fund coordination
a major part of wales , as you know , has been granted objective 1 status under the structural funds programme .
it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
we have seen poverty growing in wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .
we are looking , therefore , within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality .
what is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .
it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces .
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures .
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
we look to it to challenge the uk government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent .
this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales .
mr president , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , i will speak from the point of view of research .
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
i would like to draw people 's attention to amendments nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
these amendments also fit in with this parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund .
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively .
mr president , commissioner , the proposal presented by the commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development .
this , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .
the consequences do not inspire hope .
it is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union .
agriculture only provides 5.5 % of employment in the union .
furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
mr president , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , mr evans , of why wales actually achieved objective 1 status .
it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party .
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 1 additionality .
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation .
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hi-tech growth industries of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and underspends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the commission or in the civil service .
there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes .
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report .
she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
we are badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stands parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes .
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .
projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the union ' s regional policy in general .
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
this report is very good and our group supports it .
mr president , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions .
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .
this fact means that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically .
i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
i do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for .
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas .
this latter point is of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers .
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone .
the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year , which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part-session .
key eu programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions within europe .
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
mr president , on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues .
this time , however , i actually agree with her. whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , i cannot say .
nevertheless , i would like to commend her on her work .
unfortunately , this did not happen .
mr bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament ' s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .
personally , i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
as an islander , however , i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves .
this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament , and i have raised the issue time and time again .
commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
as for us in parliament , i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may .
i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
mr president , commissioner , in this minute and a half i should like , first of all , to congratulate mrs schroedter .
consequently , i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us .
finally , in this time of natural disasters , i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds .
as you know , it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
i also think we should ensure , or ask member states to ensure , that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .
mr president , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
as far as french planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country .
well , the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds .
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level .
the commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere .
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
to this end , europe as a whole , and each member state individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the structural funds .
for example , in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .
there are , therefore , two points to which i would like to draw the commission ' s attention .
firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided .
the report itself is well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .
i would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds .
next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .
i urge the house to support these changes .
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work .
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines .
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
mr president , mrs schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and i would like to congratulate her on that .
however , i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community ' s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the south .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states .
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
the union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
a large section of the union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots .
unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union ' s fundamental objectives .
secondly , i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the azores and madeira .
i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission ' s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awaited by parliament ?
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
mr president , commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .
i should be very grateful , mrs schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .
they are growing , but only in terms of gdp .
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .
commissioner , please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' greatest problem .
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require .
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .
this means putting forward the commission ' s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current community policies relating to structural operations .
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels .
and so , mr seppänen , i shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the cohesion fund .
this is the purpose of these guidelines .
concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date .
due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time , however , parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in july 1999 .
now to the form .
on the subject of the role of the guidelines , mrs schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .
i shall not list them all , but they include implementing intersectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc .
the commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document .
drawing to a close , i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , mrs schroedter .
i am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .
i actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .
moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .
you then mentioned , mrs schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .
i find the opposite the case .
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .
it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds , whose objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .
i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 2 zoning plans for france , sweden , austria and luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .
indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms .
i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes .
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union
the european commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions ' gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .
mr president , commissioner , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .
the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union ' s regional policy aims .
the report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe .
the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average , whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .
we now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , climates that are too cold or too hot , sparse populations and austere conditions ?
how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union ' s more remote areas .
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased .
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development .
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .
our group is in favour of adopting this report .
mr president , commissioner , the european union ' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes .
mr president , commissioner , mr berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .
the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified. i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report .
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities .
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these objective 1 regions .
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union .
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment .
from the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
as indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for .
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .
mr president , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .
by allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions .
following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give member states more say anyway .
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
finally , i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries .
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind eu countries , especially in terms of gdp per capita .
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .
mr president , commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .
genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards eu credibility .
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided , i would say quite magnificently , the development of poor countries .
i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago .
in this connection , french speakers would speak of a " coup de chapeau " : in other words , i take my hat off to the eu .
the eu really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
what is the result ?
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust .
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .
we must give them this opportunity .
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have .
the solution , as i see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
what is a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
mr president , commissioner , as my time is limited , i shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union .
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
in reunion , for example , the rate is 37 % .
this is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
the commission document expected to be ready in december 1999 was delayed until january , then february , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission .
as regards taxation , state aid , the structural funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
mr president , as all the previous speakers have done , i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .
i should also like to make a few comments , firstly , mr berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .
you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote , if i am not mistaken , that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports .
on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor , mrs wulf-mathies , i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself .
i am thinking of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resources potential , small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad .
so much for the quality .
i do not wish to spend time right now , mr berend , going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed .
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stressed , the role of local and regional authorities , the private sector , both sides of industry , associations and local community action groups .
regarding this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly .
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably .
mr fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there is growth , and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession , as has been the case in the past .
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
i agree with your analysis .
fourthly , a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now , the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people .
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses .
mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now .
i should like to mention a few specific points .
mr berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .
well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .
tomorrow , the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon , i hope , it will be italy ' s turn .
you may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 2 .
mr berend , you also mentioned , as did mr aparicio sánchez , the lack of reform in the fisheries sector .
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries , under commissioner fischler .
nonetheless , i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concerns .
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .
this will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the commission , in the next few years. and finally , there are the cross-border aspects .
i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points .
finally , i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements i should like to reiterate .
this is my first point regarding the policy .
my second point regarding the policy is as follows : the structural funds have made , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .
i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us .
i am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument , which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks .
you see , ladies and gentlemen , we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .
this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole , mr berend , is a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m. )
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
mr president , i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes .
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group .
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .
when there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships .
looking at some of the press reports of last friday , i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly .
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation .
it should not be dramatised into something more than that .
thank you very much , mr cox .
i understand what you are saying .
we have taken note of this .
mr president , concerning item 11 of the minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today 's agenda .
however , it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda .
mr wynn , that makes sense .
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .
mrs ahern , we have taken note of this .
i would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our services , however .
thank you very much .
( the minutes were approved )
reform of european competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union ' s competition policy .
however , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper .
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .
on reading both commission documents , one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .
it should continue along this path .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , commissioner , but there is one point that i would just like to go into now. transparency and accountability belong together .
i do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question .
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .
there is one thing i would like to make quite clear though .
parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .
therefore , i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
i expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful cases , even given the treaty status quo .
i also expect the commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 i would still like , regardless of mr jonckheer ' s report , to say one more thing about it .
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
my last comment was intended not so much for the commission as for the members of the group of the european people ' s party .
the commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various typologies , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage earner .
i think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be assimilated in some way into state aid .
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
the commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the member states .
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the internet .
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .
there is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , i see as particularly important .
i should like to conclude this presentation , commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of central and eastern europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the european parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the intergovernmental conference .
as you know , commissioner , our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
mr president , commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the commission .
there were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the commission submitted its own report on these .
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
the competitiveness of the european steel industry also forms the subject of the commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in parliament .
as in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .
according to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .
exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
under article 88 , the commission is obliged to supervise state aid .
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling eur 540 million to the preussag in germany .
furthermore , the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 december 1996 .
in addition , there is a special provision of up to eur 50 million for greece .
however , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .
as far as parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .
there must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
no one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .
consequently , parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the commission to provide the council with follow-up regulations .
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind .
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the european commission ' s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike .
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .
a successive phasing out of state aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition .
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living .
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market is the basis for our work .
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled .
the eu ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .
the new model now being tested by the commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the member states ' national authorities .
in six months ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the commission ' s role .
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed .
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .
parliament and the commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
in fact , in my own constituency of stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by mr von wogau and mr rapkay .
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .
mr president , as a new member i am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau , mr langen , mr rapkay and mr jonckheer , as well as the commission , for their excellent cooperation .
all this is to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
the commission has put forward a new white paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
we are not discussing the fact that although every eu law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the commission in this matter .
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
one is subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and i believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union .
i would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and gütesiegel .
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention .
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although i am not going to talk about market failure just now .
i have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but i would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters .
these days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .
however , i could also regard them as a customer , and i believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition .
apart from that , i could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .
thank you very much , mr radwan .
i would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in german parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech .
mr president , commissioner , i am speaking on behalf of my fellow member , robert goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
a slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
even if the majority in this house were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .
while , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human interchange , it has never been perfect .
the market favours the short term and immediate profits .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .
in order to function , the market needs rules .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the european union or individual states must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know-how .
the main objective of the union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the american army .
the world wide web , which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society , was developed by cern in geneva , once again with public aid .
the german government ' s intervention to save the holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .
i did not hear mr duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund , ltcm .
wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .
public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in mexico , asia and brazil .
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .
we socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in europe .
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge .
mr president , commissioner , i want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .
it is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless .
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the german government ; sawmills in former east germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .
i should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?
at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow meps , and also a scoreboard showing where the member states at present stand with regard to state aid .
you have shown us the way , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard .
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
i very much hope that you , commissioner monti , will support these amendments , and i look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
to conclude , i want to welcome the commission ' s xviiith report on competition policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
but , as i have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
mr president , commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
it is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
we feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything .
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .
mr president , once again we are debating the european union ' s competition policy .
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
the overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups .
should we not be discussing this issue ?
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies .
certain sectors of european industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremendously .
they have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .
when will we debate that ?
the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and member states of the union at that .
and yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid .
at the same time , unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
mr president , commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
having said that , governing means planning. it also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .
finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
the commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the commission at all .
national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .
state interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for european users and consumers .
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
mr president , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government ' s right and left hand , so to speak .
whilst the emu criteria are forcing member states to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .
this is understandable , because it is highly likely that member states which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave , with adverse effects on employment .
but , at the same time , this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers ' money .
in principle , only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition .
the rapporteur ' s amendments nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
amendments nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society .
vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit .
market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
if this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
the commission ' s white paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
does the pressure of work within the commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the commission ?
what is the council ' s opinion on this and is the commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points ?
mr president , a white paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave. it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views .
i also assume that you , commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiatives in order to de-europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but i have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .
in general , i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
it is true , there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
the commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
fourthly , i would like to be informed of why the commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .
they are still in training , as it were .
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market ?
sixthly and lastly , i would remind you of a point that i have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .
if the commission implements the white paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .
is the commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all member states legal privilege ?
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regarding the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .
the fact that the group of the party of european socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the white paper .
since the treaty entered into force , community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy .
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion .
for this reason , modernisation was essential .
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
i have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or prohibitions , is something less than a valid system .
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
however , they could not apply article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of article 81 ( 1 ) .
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 1762 .
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the member states and in 1994 , the commission published a communication on this subject .
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape .
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight .
at the moment , with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important .
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
frankly , i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various arguments have been presented in its favour .
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market .
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .
mr president , i would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represented by the xxviiith report on competition policy in the union , when compared to previous reports .
i would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , mr rapkay , who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .
i would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the basque country , which i represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .
this is why i give this report my full support .
i would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general .
mr president , for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union .
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
during my six months as a member of this parliament , i have become acutely aware of the determination of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project .
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe .
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission 's proposals .
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .
we look to him as the man to root out cartels .
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs , mr von wogau .
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
so although i may not share his conclusions , i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address .
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
i know that the commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .
well , we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment .
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the factortame case , in which the british government was the defendant , it took ten years for the european court to give a ruling .
so , judicially , something needs to be done .
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .
it is important that business has legal certainty .
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently .
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom .
we all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
i would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european policy .
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change .
we have been told how , currently , people 's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
but i really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
finally , we , as british conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that .
mr president , the european union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began .
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits .
that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the french writer vivienne forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror .
society is surrendering itself to the economy .
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .
european competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
in common with the other members , i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement .
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives .
a word on the white paper : the revision of articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
the system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .
the problem of overwork highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty .
mr president , i am very glad that mrs randzio-plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
as a member for the basque country , i would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
i will give you an example : the european union was right to support the grönitz steelworks in brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
but these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics .
indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .
mr president , ever since i was elected to this parliament in 1994 i have never witnessed a report which had such anti-irish sentiments and overtones as the jonckheer report which we are debating today .
i would like to quote verbatim from the report : " state aid per capita is highest in italy , germany and ireland .
ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put together . "
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe .
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
i welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in objective 1 regions in europe post-2000 .
i remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace .
no other member state is at such a disadvantage .
mr president , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe .
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something i would wholeheartedly agree with .
but opinion differs as to the solution .
the commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something i consider to be unacceptable .
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the commission will be completely in the dark in future .
this is unacceptable to my mind .
the commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and member states ' courts .
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
this is unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of european policy .
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
in any case , the commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties .
there was no majority for this at the time .
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and i am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of europe ' s consumers .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
mr president , in this important debate on competition , i am speaking this morning with particular reference to mr langen ' s document on the steel aid code .
as the court of justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances .
indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that i compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the european steel sector .
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
in the same category of ideas , it is essential that member states fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .
the commission suggests shorter deadlines. i agree with this request .
like the rapporteur , while i am pleased with the commission report , nonetheless i deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
in the interests of equality , either the code must be applied or it must be modified .
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .
mr president , i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues. firstly , i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .
i live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems : asturias .
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy .
however , it must be " europeanised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the commission giving up any of its responsibility .
i am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
the commission report confirms that , with the exception of germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .
with what aim ?
not to save jobs .
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
did these firms need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .
it is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .
mr president , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to commissioner monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film casablanca ' time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts .
this is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .
fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .
we have seen this in the aborted seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
mr president , commissioner monti , there is much that is good in mr jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .
first of all the report reveals parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly .
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this .
aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective , uneconomic division of europe ' s meagre resources .
the form the aid takes is important .
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
the report on competition policy further stresses the commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts .
there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy .
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .
safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
we ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with russia and the mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
in his report , karl von wogau manages to capture this very well .
but europe is changing .
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 member states .
the european commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this is not in question .
having said this , i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
how will the commission , as keeper of the treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in london , palermo , helsinki and , soon , budapest and ankara ?
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .
in the netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
this country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
this in contrast to germany , where a very experienced kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .
uniformity needs to be worked on .
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
what is the commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
i would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
but we all want to be oarsmen on it. we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed .
secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .
it is true , commissioner , that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said .
there have only been nine rejections .
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon .
here improvements should be made .
only in certain countries , germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bears this out .
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .
i , personally , would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report .
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups .
i will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but i do not believe that it should be exaggerated .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
in this respect , i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis-jørgensen and mr huhne of monitoring implementation .
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts .
that is why the commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , mrs peijs .
concerning mr evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
the purpose of publishing the white paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance .
this was raised by mrs thyssen , mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of smes .
many speakers have underlined this .
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .
why ?
is this simply a political gesture ?
no .
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .
most smes have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
we have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since smes are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 ( 1 ) .
the fourth group is legal certainty .
( fr ) mrs thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i. this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof .
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
i will mention only two , in order to be brief .
the first is greater transparency .
mr jonckheer , i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union .
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important .
mr jonckheer , mrs thyssen and mr gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid .
i can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .
in connection with the issue of state aid , i would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs riis-jørgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .
in april 1999 , the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .
in the near future - and i can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .
finally , mr president , i would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
i am especially grateful for all of this .
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs , and , at a more general level , with parliament .
in this regard , i liked your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
competition is not an end in itself , as mr rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in european integration .
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the european integration process , as it has done in the past .
thank you , commissioner monti .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
protection under criminal law of the union 's financial interests
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .
creating uclaf by means of the task force and setting up the anti-fraud office olaf were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the community and on local monitoring .
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
so far , efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures .
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual member states , together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 member states .
after five years only four have done so .
this state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union , has inspired parliament to initiate the setting-up of a european public prosecutor ' s office .
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being 30 september in a proposed amendment .
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states .
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called five wise men .
the commission , mr barnier , mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea .
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority .
we can set another example here , to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
at the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the community ' s financial interests , as mrs theato has explained very well .
we are all aware - and this parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the community. but be careful .
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , is a critical report .
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an own-initiative report .
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the european union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .
it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is .
we need to do something about it .
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .
the question is : who prosecutes ?
that is where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states .
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
we are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions .
of most importance to parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the european union , is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions .
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio .
i should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the commission should tackle this question .
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor .
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report .
i think it is a first-class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
but the member states failed to cooperate .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .
my colleague jan-kees wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
i think what we need is , at european level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
this , i thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
i would like to make one general point on politics .
whatever we may say about the european elections , the low turnout is a fact .
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly , and this must be done at european level .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
mrs theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions .
i believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of turnout .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the court of auditors publishes its report , which criticises the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .
so far , however , the european institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
we will need the european public prosecutor ' s office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .
having said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity .
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato ' s report receives more support .
indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is , and will be , fierce .
indeed , it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a european legal system .
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
therefore , on behalf of my group , i would like to say that we support the theato report ; i nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the igc agenda .
mr president , mrs theato ' s report on the protection of the european union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a european public prosecutor .
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .
according to the theato report , the european public prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office , olaf .
at the same time , however , we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a european union court .
in this way , a small european reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .
the union for a europe of nations group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network .
it is fine , in principle. it need only be fine-tuned .
mr president , mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi , the european police , in the form of olaf .
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code .
and indeed there is a twofold shift .
firstly , the classic eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single vat , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
next we have the puritan shift : the teutonic europe of the north , the europe of the lutherans , calvinists and quakers , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .
basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
mr president , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union , more so these days than there used to be .
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe ' s citizens .
the credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
there is no doubt that i myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at european level .
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage .
taking these aspects into account , i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf .
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving eu funds ?
i do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .
in the way it is structured , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes .
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement .
it is simply too bad , and i can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor ' s office instead .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office .
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions !
mr president , we all want to do something about combating european fraud .
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .
the tampere summit was about combating crime .
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
there is no european anti-fraud legislation in force because the member states , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .
so a great deal has to be done in this area .
and what exactly should be done ?
two things , and mrs theato ' s report clearly spells these out .
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union .
so , unification in this small area .
the european public prosecutor ' s office is nothing to be afraid of. i feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .
it is , in fact , something very positive .
just like europol. europol , involving police cooperation , does not rank above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , european public prosecutor ' s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
parliament supports this .
the committee of wise men supports this .
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same .
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in ireland and the uk .
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed .
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate .
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair , mrs theato , will not be without its critics .
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this .
that is to say , they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .
we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of community life .
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states .
in this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .
sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but i digress .
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato ' s report .
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 .
after all , there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .
nothing has changed there .
as far as that is concerned , i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
mr president , for years , parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .
on the other hand , more pro-active attempts , such as olaf , which is currently operating , have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
mr president , the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged .
to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .
at the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the eu must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few member states .
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .
on the other hand , i am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
in the present situation , i am therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten ' s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
olaf , the european anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .
this is why the commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and i hope that parliament approves this step .
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions .
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
in other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .
there is one thing i would ask though : i believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the misconception that olaf does not now have enough authority .
no , there must be no undermining of olaf ' s authority , and neither do i think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .
as such , i would ask you to give olaf ' s work your full support , also in its present form .
thank you , commissioner schreyer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.

heaton-harris ( ppe-de ) .
mr president , on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rules of procedure : namely rules 133 ( 2 ) and 138 ( 4 ) .
these are both about voting .
that is quite right , mr heaton-harris. i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it .
in this particular case , i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .
mr president , i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
i know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
i shall , i assure you , mr heaton-harris , pay particular attention to the show of hands .
i hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
procedure without debate :
( parliament approved the legislative resolution )
. ( fr ) the european union is apparently financed through four own resources .
since then , community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of community resources .
since then , of course , this europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission .
furthermore , the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying member states .
this is a long way from offshoots such as the " community criminal code " , the " european public prosecutor " or a european police force , with olaf .
there is as yet no federal european tax .
all the same , a europe with 25 members will be wanting a european tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 2025 .
koch report ( a5-0105 / 1999 )
- ( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention. directive 96 / 35 / ec was a response to this requirement .
in order to facilitate achieving this objective , directive 96 / 35 / ec provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
while this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .
it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .
parliament voted in favour of this text .
in order to be realistic , i further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .
koch report ( a5-0104 / 1999 )
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then .
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 january 1997 .
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 january 1999 .
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
until then , there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations .
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable european standards .
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
schroedter report ( a5-0108 / 1999 )
mr president , i wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development .
i would urge both the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in europe .
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
despite the fact that the community , through the structural funds among others , injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe , these disparities continue to exist .
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report , i have this important reservation .
- the schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of eu structural funds in europe for the period 2000-2006 .
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster , i have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national eu funds .
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of european structural funds .
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas .
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland .
once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .
during the next round of eu structural funds 2000-2006 , other eu initiatives such as " equal " and " urban " will be operating .
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent .
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes .
they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , european and local funding .
. ( fr ) this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
but more especially because , even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
jacques delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
mrs schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid .
amended again as such by the schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject. in the meantime , let us support this first step .
- this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some member states .
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
in my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .
whether we are talking about beef to france or about backhanders to industry , eu member states must not be allowed to flout the law .
i enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per member state .
countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed .
member states cannot be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling .
much remains to be done , however , and i call on the commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of europe .
unfortunately , the european commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight .
this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .
the truth is though , that the commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
a considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time .
this is why the mid-term review , provided for under article 42 of regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
that said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
berend report ( a5-0107 / 1999 )
. ( pt ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states , which is what the report proposes .
. ( fr ) the berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the european union .
expenditure becomes an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
the statistics published by the european commission in its sixth report do however show , as mr berend pointed out , the limitations of the policy being implemented :
the poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment .
in 1986 , the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41 % of the overall community gnp .
in 1996 it was 50 % .
progress is particularly marked in portugal and ireland .
this is a generalised tendency , sparing neither the rhône-alpes , nor alsace .
it has been confirmed in sweden and finland , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years , as in many regions of the united kingdom .
it may therefore seem strange that , when the structural funds were reformed , objective 2 , dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring , should have been sacrificed in favour of objectives 1 and 3 .
for the period 1999-2006 , the total appropriation for this objective will be ecu 22.5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999 .
based as it is on such choices , it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the member states of the european union .
von wogau report ( a5-0069 / 1999 )
as an example i would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power. a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today .
the management of abb alsthom power , following a merger carried out in june 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the european works council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened .
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states .
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union .
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .
is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament ?
the german social democrats voted against the von wogau report because , in their view , it might break up european policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardising superstate .
curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the european " one-stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
rapkay report ( a5-0078 / 1999 )
the members of parliament from the lutte ouvrière party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy .
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power .
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the european union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote .
this is repulsive most of all in social terms .
- ( fr ) in voting against this report , we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in seattle and throughout europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .
this report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .
whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
jonckheer report ( a5-0087 / 1999 )
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the european commission .
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder .
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .
langen report ( a5-0073 / 1999 )
in the important debate on competition this morning , i expressed my views on mr langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code .
just as the court of justice recognised in its order of 3 may 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .
at the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .
in the same way , it is vital for member states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under article 7 of the steel aid code .
the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminders .
like the rapporteur , i am pleased with the commission report , but i did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
in the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or modify the code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
my feeling in this respect is that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .
for all these reasons i voted in favour of the langen report , and i now await the commission ' s response to our requests and demands .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
oil slick off the french coast
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .
mr president , i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppe-de group , but also as an elected representative for brittany , and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe-de group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline , and why ?
if , i repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .
well , if the charterer is exonerated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations .
moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission .
what are the conditions for this recognition ?
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?
you are going to commission a fact-finding mission .
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up .
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries .
why not ?
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
if the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the united states .
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team .
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
i could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this parliament but i only have three minutes .
how many more erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the european union , not just certain areas of it ?
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?
how many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any erika-type disaster ?
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively .
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods .
just as the sea empress , just as the braer did .
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
the time for resolutions has passed .
what is now needed is action .
sadly , i fear , the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
mr president , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
the " erika " incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of europe .
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift .
with every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick , sticky , black tar .
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? "
indeed this disaster involving the erika , like that of the russian vessel in turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available .
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , " never again ! "
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many .
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
i can testify to this remarkable work .
you are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
in relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .
and , on this subject , commissioner , you did not mention how the commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible. in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .
this is no longer tolerable .
next , we have flags of convenience .
according to the international transport federation , over 40 % of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .
this is no longer tolerable .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible .
this is no longer tolerable .
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
i am thinking specifically of total-fina in the present instance .
this is an approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .
in so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
admittedly , there is the international oil pollution compensation fund , iopcf , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo .
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the european union .
in addition , there are community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. it is now scheduled for july .
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future. this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
thus , the erika was refused access to american waters .
if the european community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
let us ensure , mr president , commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media hype and the shock of this house have died down .
mr president , torrey canyon , olympic bravery , haven , amoco cadiz , gino , tanio , so many names we remember with horror .
and now the erika .
whose turn is next ? twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
and this is the result .
as an elected representative for the loire-atlantique region , unfortunately , i can testify to this .
there is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .
they are the result of human thoughtlessness .
what we have here is an ecological disaster .
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the commission ?
next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .
in fact , according to the experts , the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .
we know what actually happened .
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years old .
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea .
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group .
mr president , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
it is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major european state ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .
the 15 clearly do not suffice .
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the european union again .
all those involved , including the transport agent , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .
this is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
however , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
in other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
many thanks for this .
this also means that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today .
the erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level , nature and the environment come off second-best .
the damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members .
what i learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner ?
first of all , the port-state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .
i think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .
so this 25 % should be increased .
but this is not in place .
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .
finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the united states , ships should in any case be double-hulled .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
mr president , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
we have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union .
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .
so what are we to do now ?
i have no intention of talking about past events ; rather i want to look to the future .
what are we to do now ?
i will tell you a few things we should do .
of course , we need double-hulled vessels .
that goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
so what do we need to happen immediately ?
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .
we need this at european level and internationally ; we need something like a tüv , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany , which is compulsory every two years .
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
this is what we need for ships .
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the european union .
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
we must reach agreement here , in all the european union ' s ports , from marseilles , through to rotterdam , to wilhelmshaven , cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
environmental standards will be a recurring theme .
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .
the unions will have something to say as will industry .
a long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !
mr president , mrs roth-behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
we have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
i would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the plimsoll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
i consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that mrs roth-behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have brought up for discussion .
we must also critically examine the classification societies .
i do not think that we can accept their procedures .
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
within the commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .
how is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .
in these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .
mr president , i am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .
however , we must stick to the facts .
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .
i have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls .
i cannot accept this .
if the member states decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .
secondly , i also share the commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .
that is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
mrs roth-behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .
there are reputable companies too .
mr president , commissioner , the erika sank near my home and is still there , with 20 000 tonnes in its hold , the fate of which we are waiting to discover .
it could have sunk anywhere .
my first thoughts are for the 26 indian sailors , who were saved but of whom nothing has been said .
there could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means , above all , men ' s lives .
by now they are far away .
it is a miracle that they were saved .
in particular , we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public , as currently , we do not have access to them .
then , sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 member states ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the union .
we must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience , not because they are necessarily bad boats , but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones .
we must improve information on all of the world ' s ships , but provision has already been made for this. we must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them .
with regard to this matter , i would like to know who owns the erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing , but there are always real shareholders in the background .
where are the erika ' s owners ?
perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches , getting a nice tan .
we would like to know their names and their faces .
finally , there must be improvements in the training of crews .
in our society there is no such thing as zero-risk , but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety .
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .
having spent a lot of time at sea myself i am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
in that context i support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
i support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .
these are the same areas , commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts , without any control whatsoever .
i come from a region , galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on malta ' s accession to the european union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag .
on the other hand , prevention is essential .
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks .
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :
first , the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina , the italian shipping register , because we need to know if community law was applied .
that should be the starting point for our efforts .
once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
commissioner , i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
commissioner , i believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
i think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
the commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .
we sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
in this area we must respond to public opinion .
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ' polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous .
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
states can carry out port inspections .
in europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive .
however , it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .
where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed european commission ?
can the commission provide an assurance that directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all member states ?
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
in short , to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .
the erika was built at a japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .
there are four more sister ships in service at present .
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high .
some of them also sail under the maltese flag .
are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
rina is currently the talk of the town .
malta is entering the accession negotiations .
in my opinion , the european union can only accept malta if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .
like so many others , i too wonder where the people responsible are .
where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur ?
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether intentional or unintentional .
( the president cut the speaker off )
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament .
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the british media .
although britain and france have had their differences recently , i can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
moreover , although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
i sincerely hope that , particularly during the french presidency later this year , the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options , and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament .
the victims are waiting outside .
they want answers .
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .
the citizens are right to ask : " do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? "
who will provide us with new jobs ?
that is why i welcome mrs palacio ' s action plan with open arms .
it is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .
but there is an art to that as well .
deploying the german multipurpose ship " neuwerk " - it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help .
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .
valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in parliament .
the issue is as topical as it was before .
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow meps , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation .
i would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem .
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .
mrs roth-behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .
in fact , i believe that things have been done by the commission , but there is still more to do .
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
that is the reality .
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
the romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community .
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .
i believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the european union countries .
we already have legislation .
according to the information which the commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily .
lastly , i would like to stress the issue of liability .
not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which i believe should be similar to those in the united states .
we have set a figure of usd 180 million ; in the united states they are talking about usd 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .
i will end now. i will not expand further .
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
the political will of this parliament is required - and i can see that i can count on this - as well as that of the council of ministers .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we have taken good note of your intentions .
i have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present commission statement .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12.00 p.m.
storms in europe
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe .
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission .
i think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
in fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
let me explain .
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of deciduous forest .
indeed , for some ' forestry ' districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
indeed , you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate .
on the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
i am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and i thank the commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .
as you yourself said , commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
firstly , i would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .
they have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens .
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly .
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
as you said , commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to fifg for investments that have been totally wiped out .
beyond this , i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on 11 january 2000 .
i can show you a copy if you wish .
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the union. that , however , is another problem altogether .
mr president , commissioner , europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december .
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region , lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .
i would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their troubles are not yet over .
it is europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of member states affected by the disaster .
i welcome mr barnier ' s statement and i also welcome the measures which the commission has announced .
i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .
the community action programme for civil protection , established by a council decision on 9 december , was launched on 1 january 2000 .
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity. this programme must work at full capacity .
although it may have been effective in certain areas - and i do not doubt the sincerity of commissioner barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry .
our priority , as we wait for community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states .
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
finally , it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls .
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states .
this aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas .
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .
this is a very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies .
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .
current programmes must be accelerated .
for example , as they stand , the commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under kyoto .
the trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shelves it .
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate !
commissioner , mr president , lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .
however , it has now achieved notoriety .
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in france and germany , but also in switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .
the wind triumphed over electricity pylons , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .
if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest sometime in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as an individual .
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
all this is well-intentioned advice .
however , i come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry predominates and i can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
the thinning-out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree .
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
mr president , commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , nato , with the participation of most member states of the european union , flattened kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .
we are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the eu .
the commission in brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders .
" we do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .
this is wrong !
and no one can comprehend this attitude .
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .
i say they have a right to solidarity .
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .
it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations .
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament , i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and i hope that february does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !
mr president , commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems .
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
there is certainly a need for european civil protection , and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .
of course , i am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
but when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground .
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
to this day , we in europe remain in the privileged position of having the gulf stream , and the gulf stream still does its stuff .
america and south-east asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream .
but in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .
this is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference .
we must reduce co2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of europe are faring .
mr president , i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .
this is an irreparable loss .
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with france , which is the country worst affected .
as i have little time , mr president , i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .
i believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals .
secondly , i was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner ' s proposal to create a european civil protection body .
furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards .
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
that is important .
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past .
it was very small .
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major .
officials and ministers from member states were coming to brussels , whispering with the commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
i think we should reinstate this budget line .
when we had the earthquake in greece , which was a big disaster , the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks .
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now .
these are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic .
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these .
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines .
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around .
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul .
mr president , commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that europe gets off relatively lightly .
nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in alsace as well .
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
the calculations are in decades rather than years .
i am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank .
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland .
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e.coli-infected water .
i talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .
natural habitats were destroyed .
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case .
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , tom spencer .
he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday .
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission 's green paper on food law was published .
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .
the white paper also reflects the concerns of this parliament which you have outlined to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this house since the commission was appointed .
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe 's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .
the most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of europe .
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .
the challenge is to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders .
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation .
all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
over 80 measures are envisaged .
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments .
we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage .
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern is independence .
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis .
however , the commission believes that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment .
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it is the correct one .
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority .
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
i also reject this line of argument .
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interests of europe 's citizens ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states .
this is a major task .
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-eminent on the european stage .
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation .
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin .
this revised community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at community level , community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
these could include withholding community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a member state .
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the union .
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation .
as regards the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission is currently finalising a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon .
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , i recognise that this was not feasible .
but i know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the white paper 's proposals on the authority .
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the commission 's ideas on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority .
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .
parliament played a crucial role in europe 's response to the bse crisis .
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
i expect that parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and garner our views , i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu 's food safety regime in the years ahead .
it is essential that we get the mix right .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions , including the commission and parliament .
that is very much the right approach .
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight .
i hope that we can thrash this out .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
it is very important that we include liability in that process .
that is the one word i am talking about .
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
that cannot continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
mr president , it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you are unclear about this in your white paper .
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
the final part of my question is as follows : when will bse testing be binding in all member states ?
that is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality .
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from brussels and under-implementation in the member states ?
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth-behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper .
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability .
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .
mrs roth-behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list is , as i say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
i hope that the next time you ask me the question , i will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen .
i also welcome the white paper .
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france 's refusal to lift the ban ?
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting .
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?
for example , the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .
i envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .
i do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that .
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of views on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament - or indeed parliament nominees - to be members of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominees or even meps themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity .
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible .
it must be known .
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
it must be visible .
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end .
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
it is something that is earned over a period of time .
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission , parliament and council .
i realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is - i believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to mrs lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .
mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority .
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
i recognise that the feo is located in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe !
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in dublin .
the food safety authority 's situation is quite different .
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation .
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
that is my judgement at the moment .
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents .
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner , and his statement .
as you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions .
that concludes the debate .
question time ( commission )
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first part
question no 28 by ( h-0781 / 99 ) :
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
in particular , the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .
thank you for your reply .
i should like to make the following points : turkey is now a candidate country .
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire cadou type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect .
the safety factor in this type of project , and i am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .
however , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
i have explained the position of the commission .
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable .
in the case of turkey it is different .
the plant is not yet there. i have already said that turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey .
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania , slovakia and bulgaria .
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
i do not have these concerns .
question no 29 by ( h-0786 / 99 ) :
subject : depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict ?
if not , why not ?
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission .
thank you , mr bowe , for your question .
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .
as early as last june the commission financed a first study .
it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme - balkan task force .
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net .
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf fact-finding mission .
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
from a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern europe .
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed .
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
this uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war .
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of kosovo .
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
that is also mentioned in the report .
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
it also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
mr president , commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to .
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
i cannot answer that question .
when it comes to medical checks and so on , i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups i do not have the information about that .
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question no 30 by ( h-0793 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over 4000 tibetans who escaped over the himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared .
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including tibet , firmly and candidly to the chinese authorities .
the european union did that at the european union ­ china summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .
i urge the chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities .
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile .
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this , then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council .
as it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the council makes the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet .
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness , the dalai lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition .
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .
the commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .
at or around the time of president clinton 's visit to china , the president of the people 's republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
question no 31 by ( h-0795 / 99 ) :
are these reports accurate ?
what is the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure .
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be noted that the new commission gave an immediate follow-up to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission 's administration with the public .
it will be adopted through a legally-binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities .
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman 's office .
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper reports were misleading .
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman .
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that .
i want to repeat that honourable members , like the honourable member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
" i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .
both documents , that is the commission 's document and the ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the members to bear in mind .
as the author is not present , question no 32 lapses .
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. i am sorry .
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .
i wish you a good evening .
second part
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten
questions 33 and 34 of questions to the commission were intended for mr nielson .
mr nielson cannot be present today since he is in south africa .
question no 33 by ( h-0829 / 99 ) :
subject : ' mainstreaming ' in eu aid policy in 1995 the council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( ' mainstreaming ' ) into the full range of eu aid policy .
' mainstreaming ' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
to achieve that , the council 's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety .
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days ' training in such issues should form an essential part of the directorate-general for development 's introductory courses for new staff .
is the commission prepared to take such measures ?
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate-general for development at all levels .
it is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .
it would appear that we are in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers .
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
extremely few members of the directorate-general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
that is naturally unacceptable .
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .
as i point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
my question is this : is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate-general for development ?
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .
and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said .
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
question no 34 by ( h-0831 / 99 ) :
subject : aid for central asia what development aid and what humanitarian aid does the commission grant to the countries of central asia , and what is its assessment of the impact of this aid ?
questions to mrs diamantopoulou
since 1991 , the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia .
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme .
in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur 75 million .
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , tajikistan .
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million .
since 1993 the commission 's european community humanitarian office , echo , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3.8 million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
mr president , commissioner , there is a risk of central asia and the caspian sea becoming the balkans of the 21st century .
that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of turkmenistan and uzbekistan in particular .
we were able , at the istanbul summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the central asian republics .
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
i can send the honourable member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the central asian republics .
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side .
but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia. i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well .
so the honourable member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation .
those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land .
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
we also take good note of the fact that the member who has asked the question has applauded the commissioner ' s answer .
this is not the usual state of affairs .
and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .
thank you very much , mr patten , for your interventions today .
question no 35 by ( h-0778 / 99 ) :
could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitments are ?
has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing , recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?
as far as mr papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 action plan for employment , the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the action plan for employment .
the greek government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " yes to work " and " back to work " .
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made .
thank you , commissioner for your reply .
you tell me that you , as the commission , have made recommendations .
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
did anyone find work ?
how many people found work ?
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
what has been done about training ?
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees ?
do we have any figures ?
in other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece ?
greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as i can see , an increase in productivity .
the action which the commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .
as you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .
they concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed .
the commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
question no 36 by ( h-0782 / 99 ) :
the danish pension scheme , the efterløn , only allows people resident in denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in denmark to retire .
some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire .
the danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under danish law .
the commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the danish government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
the last meeting on the subject was held in november 1999 and we are waiting for the commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against denmark .
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission .
i should like to ask the commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the danish socio-political debate .
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
honourable member , i should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other member states are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .
i think that the answer is brief and clear .
of course it is as you say .
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark , that is not where the problem lies .
the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark .
question no 37 by ( h-0791 / 99 ) :
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors .
the content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .
the council , commission and parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
parliament has proposed 4 years , the commission 7 and the council 13 .
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
question no 38 by ( h-0805 / 99 ) :
which commissioners are members of this group ?
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
what concrete measures have been discussed ?
this question covers several individual matters .
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality .
the commissioners taking part are president prodi , vice-president kinnock , mr reding and myself .
the meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 january 2000 .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your reply , although i regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance .
we trusted this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .
mrs avilés-perea , that was an exhortation rather than a question .
but if the commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...
allow me to say just one word. i agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .
question no 39 by ( h-0807 / 99 ) :
under this umbrella , each member state is to submit proposals in the form of a community initiative programme for that particular country .
what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states ' programmes ?
which community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?
the european social fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. as the equal initiative is a joint funding venture with the member states , what will greece 's contribution amount to ?
the equal initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .
the decision on this initiative was taken in berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
this is an important aspect of this initiative .
the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with the regulation .
this is the same as the social fund regulation , i.e. equal comes under the social fund regulation .
it has been submitted to parliament and we expect parliament ' s opinion next month .
i should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed european strategy .
the member states , i.e. the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .
within the european commission , the directorate-general for employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the directorate-general for financial control , the anti-fraud office and the european court of auditors .
the last question concerns the amount granted .
mr president , i feel that the guidelines for the community equal initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure .
for example , one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .
however , this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .
however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is rendered impossible or merely symbolic .
secondly , i have to say that the aim of the equal initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .
that is the job of the european strategy for employment and the social fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like greece .
question no 40 by ( h-0808 / 99 ) :
subject : article 13 teu and employment the draft commission directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( art . 4.2 ) .
could the commission please tell parliament the circumstances and the groups within article 13 ( teu ) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?
a month ago , the commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the treaty , in order to implement article 13 .
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .
at the commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , member states and the european parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about .
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .
this is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .
for instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a roman catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian .
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .
in other words , it is positive discrimination .
in the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic .
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .
question no 41 by ( h-0813 / 99 ) :
does the commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?
obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the structural funds , the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy .
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .
i should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000-2006 , i.e. eur 195 billion , will go to the less-favoured regions of europe .
commissioner , thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer , which has been rigorous and well-argued .
however , i can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions .
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .
i am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .
i can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies .
the commissioner accepts and takes good note of mrs izquierdo rojo ' s intervention .
question no 42 by ( h-0817 / 99 ) :
can the commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?
we estimate that the commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with parliament , the social partners and non-governmental organisations .
these discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon .
the lisbon european council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .
these results will be most important in shaping the commission ' s social programme .
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
we need to see which concrete alternatives the commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .
firstly , i agree with you entirely .
account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which i too mentioned .
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .
since the author is not present , question no 43 lapses .
question no 44 by ( h-0819 / 99 ) :
however , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .
what measures is the commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?
on 26 november 1999 , the european commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .
as far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .
of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
the european commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , coaches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them .
i would thank the commissioner for her answer .
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .
i am grateful for the fact that the commission has adopted an action plan .
it is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability .
i referred to the directive which the commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .
it has not yet been passed by the council ; it is at the consultation stage .
i think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at european level .
i think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport .
that is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .
question no 45 by ( h-0006 / 00 ) :
subject : compliance with directive 96 / 71 / ec concerning the posting of workers the posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in denmark , even though the deadline has passed .
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .
there are therefore two possible solutions : either the directive is inapplicable in denmark , or denmark is required by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .
if not , will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area ?
the european union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country .
what it says it that one of two things may apply , i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector .
in other words , to put it simply , denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
discussions are being held between the european commission and denmark , and denmark is expected to notify the commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission ' s questions expired on 6 december 1999 and we have not received a reply .
we are waiting to see what the next move will be .
firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country .
as i said earlier , there are always problems interpreting the directives of the european commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another .
as far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to denmark .
it is not only denmark which has matters pending .
five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .
and this is the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine governments to move .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your dedication .
you have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .
we congratulate you .
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes question time .
( the sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
1997 discharge
the commissioner , mrs schreyer , is not here yet , but i hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .
mr president , i am sure that mrs schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .
i would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .
mr president , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .
in its resolution , this parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far-reaching proposals for reform from the new european commission .
this report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of mr kinnock ' s reforms .
it is an excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans .
in the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial drafts , that the commission had made very important pledges .
we asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation , and this is now in place .
parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
this has now been done .
parliament requires a code of conduct for commissioners and cabinets .
this is in place too .
parliament asked the commission to waive its excessive privileges .
it did this as well .
the commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with parliament in terms of sem 2000 .
fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .
these are sound , first steps which illustrate that , if this parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .
we want more than that , however .
the commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
this is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen .
we now demand from the european commission clear pledges concerning the following points .
firstly , parliament must have complete access to all commission documents .
this , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .
in the context of providing information , i would like to draw the commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .
if the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .
we would also like a clear job description for each european official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful .
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the european court of auditors and its national counterparts .
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 march of this year .
i would quote gaza as an example .
it is unacceptable that the commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left unused .
mr president , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .
it is one of the most powerful weapons parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .
this is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
however , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .
indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the court of auditors have been cleared up .
finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the commission .
but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order .
as long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reforming the union .
the reforms of the european institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue europe ' s development process .
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic .
all institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of europe .
mr president , the committee on industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .
during the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .
they were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .
the first is a tendency for the commission to embark on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing .
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .
i know that all the institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the commission and for some of the lack of resources .
that cannot excuse everything that we came across .
citizens of europe expect the european institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .
that is why i want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of europe by mr prodi and mr kinnock .
from what i have seen of the reform process , it looks good .
i saw some of mr kinnock 's papers today , i heard some of what he had to say .
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
but we need that reform process .
many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in mrs van der laan 's report .
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
it seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .
it groups them together and that is very important .
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to .
one is nuclear safety in eastern europe .
we have to get this right .
the committee of independent experts said the commission was not managing this properly .
we have to remedy that .
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .
we need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .
it has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .
i hope colleagues in this house will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .
the socialist group will be voting to grant discharge .
i am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well .
but that is not to say that we are satisfied , and that everything in the garden is rosy .
it is clear that a radical overhaul of the commission is long overdue .
it indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .
i just want to outline some of the issues that we , as socialists , have put down as amendments .
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .
first of all , the immunity of officials : this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor .
we need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .
it is critical to note that the commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the court of auditors .
the court 's report is there for a reason , our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through .
i have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the commission .
even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .
too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .
we want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future .
the other issue is access to confidential documents .
we have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had .
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential .
we have put down an amendment to that effect .
one issue which is referred to in the van der laan report is the whole question of the gaza hospital .
the situation there is totally unacceptable .
we will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .
i would like to congratulate lousewies van der laan .
i do not usually bother congratulating people but i think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks .
mr president , commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .
we are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the commission ' s responsibility .
i would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks .
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .
it is about a commission which is no more .
there is now a new commission .
then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned ?
the problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .
we have to take a decision now regarding the commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .
mr kinnock will present his proposal next month .
we are all very much anticipating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled .
this dilemma stretches beyond the areas which i have already listed .
take , for example , the pledges made by the commission .
they look good in themselves .
i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
but i will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .
the previous speaker already said something about this .
a document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .
this is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results .
this also applies to whistle-blowers .
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
so there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .
this also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the committee on industry has introduced .
clear progress must be visible .
at present , we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .
finally , mr president , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last commission .
in assessing the question of whether or not to grant the commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
in that year , we voted against granting discharge .
as a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .
we think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the court of auditors .
it is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .
so far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .
we are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .
mr president , first of all , i have only positive comments to make on mrs van der laan ' s very expert work on this report .
the union for a europe of nations group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .
the report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .
we support these critical remarks , and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .
again , i must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new commission ' s accountability for the future .
we do not think that the new commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .
we think it is wrong to talk about the commission ' s liability as an institution .
the mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new commission can do any better .
by means of this extraordinary procedure , parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs , namely with the previous commission .
it was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating .
there is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
that is just the way things are , however .
in taking over the mandate , the new commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .
this question ought to have been asked when the new commission was appointed .
if parliament votes in favour of the committee on budgetary control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .
for it is the third section of mrs van der laan ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .
the comments contained within , under eight headings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission presents its reform programme .
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority .
mr president , we all recall that parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new european commission regarding internal reform .
in response to this the commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .
it is fair to say that the new president , mr prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this parliament .
existing eu treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate .
mr president , the commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .
1997 was a matter for the old commission and , therefore , the new commission does not think that it can accept liability .
it is true that implementation of the budget for 1997 fell within the old commission ' s remit .
the new commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and i must admit that i am not impressed at all .
the old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .
there are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start .
i do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly .
i am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving echo .
i am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .
i am the rapporteur for echo on the committee on budgetary control , and i shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the commission will not give me the necessary information .
from the outside , it looks as if the commission has something to hide .
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
the commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the commission .
it was this practice which led to the commission ' s downfall .
i can therefore fully support the demand to give parliament unconditional right of access to documents .
otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .
thank you , commissioner schreyer .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
response to second report of committee of independent experts
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .
on 15 march the committee published its first report concluding that : " it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility " .
within a few hours of the presentation of the report president santer announced the resignation of his entire team .
the resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident parliament and a european commission mired in allegations of scandal .
since then the brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorated parliament has been elected and a new commission confirmed in office .
the new commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .
a code of conduct for commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer goods .
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .
the number of departments has been reduced .
the commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated .
in order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .
first , financial management and control within the commission must be improved .
one of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
the commission 's dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .
a new independent audit system service must be set up .
dgs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .
in return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .
it is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes .
but while the commission must ensure that it respects the treaty and the financial regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .
urgent change is required today .
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive .
this requires a clear example to be set by commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , by the middle of this year .
third , standards in european public life must be upheld .
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .
a number of codes have since been introduced .
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding .
whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected .
at the end of last year mr kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers .
they must be implemented without delay .
although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong .
crucially , reforms must not be limited to the commission .
parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .
finally , the commission 's human resource policy must be modernised .
it is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive .
too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .
merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .
the promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .
last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
this communication must contain a clear timetable .
with a new commission and a new parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .
enlargement of the union is just a few years away .
now is the time for europe to put its own house in order ; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .
in june of last year europe 's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .
there is a very simple way to deal with those stories .
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .
all the experts can provide information and news , formulate opinions and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so .
it is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the european parliament or its committees any documentation .
members of parliament must possess the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .
i would point out that there is no european legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each member state .
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .
i am opposed to european community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium .
this debate on the van hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the european institutions since their creation in 1957 .
remember that the council of ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the commission itself resigned on 15 march .
now we come to the second report of the committee of independent experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last september .
our greatest concern in the epp is to ensure that public confidence in the european commission is restored .
further steps to build a strong europe will be to no avail if the european peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials .
under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .
we are therefore concerned to see the flurry of commission announcements in recent weeks by commissioner kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a white paper shortly .
while conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .
our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the commission wants to limit severely the access of parliament to information .
this was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last commission .
have the lessons not been learnt ?
the knowledge that the framework relations between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the commission to take up in its reform package .
the less precise , mr van hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the commission and your former colleagues in the council to do what they like .
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men ' s report should be implemented .
looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the european commission .
we want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .
commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occurred .
in a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .
our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
we will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .
let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of commission reform .
mr president , i must start by apologising that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation .
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report .
it is an excellent report .
it would have been wrong for parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .
it is right for us to have a focused report which is what mr van hulten has produced .
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse .
yes , a lot of things were lost by the socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may i warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his efforts so far .
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
it is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the commission .
it is clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation .
that is important .
we need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .
where failure is occurring within the commission we need to hold people responsible .
we need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission .
we cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the european taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .
i will give you one example of this .
in the 1998 court of auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to italian wine cost the taxpayers of europe gbp 8 to 10 million .
it is clear that is not acceptable .
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .
we recognise that most of the officials within the commission are extremely hard-working .
but we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones .
the european parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .
we have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
our own staff policy is outdated .
some of our working practices need radical reform .
i hope that the european parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the commission in this reform process .
we recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting .
we recognise that means discipline on the part of commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .
finally , can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .
european taxpayers need to be re-assured .
the fate of the commission , of the whole european union , rests on delivery of this reform .
that is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .
mr president , i would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur , mr van hulten , on his first report .
i very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .
we have submitted an amendment to this effect .
from the many points made by mr van hulten in his report , i would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly .
firstly , i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .
the commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .
we noticed this when we had to investigate the flechard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sorted out .
curiously , very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets , even from those of the president and of various directorates-general , and this is clearly something which should not happen .
if parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and i would like to know what the commission intends to do to improve this situation .
i would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .
this has also been partly dealt with in the van hulten report .
i think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .
the general impression at present is that anything budget-related within europe is bad .
it is clear that , over the past couple of years , we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .
is this possible ?
i would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out .
if we admit new member states then we need to put our own house in order first .
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten .
it is his first report here in plenary .
this is worth a compliment although i regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue .
it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .
in my opinion , this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control .
let us be honest .
the second report of the wise men arrived in september .
we are now four months down the line .
meanwhile , mr van hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .
he went back to work , rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions , but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round .
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
mr van hulten , my group of the greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to embellish this report .
after all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the committee of wise men word for word in your report .
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable .
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the committee of wise men .
in any event , i look forward to the document which was approved by the commission today .
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february .
i think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .
mr president , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .
they are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .
via the structural funds , a great deal of the european budget is being pumped around the system .
this is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich member states contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer member states .
but there is also funding which is being pumped via brussels back to the same rich member states .
districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pronounced .
even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .
it will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .
it would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a european detour .
this is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less overheads , more transparency and more democracy .
mr president , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .
trade union representatives sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulations committee , thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the staff regulations in their fossilised state .
i therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .
mr president , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the european commission is in a catch-22 situation .
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission .
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this chamber sound , the more applause they receive .
this may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the committee on budgetary control as regards this issue .
nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and i would expressly like to thank mr van hulten for the work he has done on this report .
provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the commission on a number of crucial points .
allow me to start with the most important demand .
we do not want financial control to be abolished .
the commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by renaming the directorate-general for financial control as the directorate-general for audits , for example .
it may well be easy enough to change the commission ' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .
this cannot be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our committee .
it is to be welcomed that mr van hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .
a few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague .
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked .
mr president , firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , mr van hulten .
it is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and i am , i think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
mr president , the commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .
the call to make a cultural u-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .
it would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .
this is the best support we can give to european democracy .
if , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century , we are witnessing a very special moment indeed .
mr president , first of all , congratulations to michiel van hulten for his first report .
it was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .
mr van hulten , i think you deserve a medal for your efforts .
there are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the eldr .
firstly , there is the commissioners ' individual responsibility .
this must be regulated during the igc .
secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , mr mulder , the eldr is of the opinion that the european parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .
this will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the european citizens in this institution .
we at the european parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own house in order as well .
only when all european institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive europe which our citizens now finally deserve .
mr president , i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the house .
i am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the commission , demanded by our citizens .
this parliament has often heard the desire to reform the commission expressed , even by its presidents .
it now appears that this desire is more serious .
this parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme .
the report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the committee of experts commissioned by this parliament .
mr prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , i can assure him that he will have the support of this house in the reform process .
we want a strong commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .
therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties .
perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise .
i do not know your exact view in this respect , mr kinnock , but it is clear that we want commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .
we want a structure which allows every euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .
mr president , the santer commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line .
therefore , the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .
naturally , this is only to be welcomed .
what i do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to dispense with independent - and i stress , independent - prior approval .
up until now , the commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .
and so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .
a single key is to suffice in future .
the financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the commission .
if you will pardon me for saying so , mr kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .
what we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .
this could be achieved by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .
it is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .
however , the financial controllers must work independently .
that is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the commission , when it talks in terms of decentralisation .
it is obviously the commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual directorates-general , but this is precisely what we do not want .
surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the leonardo affair , when the internal examiners in the relevant directorate-general issued warnings , but these were neither heeded nor passed on .
therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control subscribes to .
indeed , the new commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
i believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .
mrs theato has already expressed as much and i am only too willing to support her in this regard .
mr president , a couple of years ago , the previous commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise .
this was stupid of the old commission , and parliament was of no help on that occasion .
when i read mr van hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , i am afraid that parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air .
there are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .
there is no backbone , and no teeth .
where is the beef ?
and i would also say this to you , commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is british .
romano prodi promised a revolution .
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts !
sort out the tangle of staff allowances .
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .
ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .
do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .
it is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .
we have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .
mr president , i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i voted for it .
so i refer to the things i do not agree with .
i do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to parliament .
this report is about the commission .
parliament is a separate subject .
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission .
in addition to that , there is the question of duty-free .
that was a stick used to beat the commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the commission abolished duty-free in airports .
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either .
most of the report is about financial control .
that is reasonable because it comes from the budgetary control committee .
but we should not create the impression that vast amounts of european resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the european commission .
after all , it is only 1 % of gdp , by comparison with national spending .
so carelessness within the commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money .
we should get it into perspective .
it is important to remember that .
the business of the european commission is very little about spending money .
they have very little of it .
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .
if there is , we have generated it in this house in the past year .
i have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the council , the commission and parliament .
that is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were .
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the commission that went before it .
while there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
mr president , i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .
the process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the commission .
the commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .
naturally , there are good , capable employees in the commission , and they are in the majority .
but we need radical reform .
there is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
people should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .
the financial regulation should be amended .
we agree that we should have better control of the finances .
it is just a question of how .
the commission and the committee of independent experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .
we should be careful about this .
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
it is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .
instead , we should be reforming and decentralising control .
the commission does not have enough staff .
and the commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .
the staffing system is too rigid .
there should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees .
i am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .
after all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .
mr president , commissioners , first of all , i cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is , on the whole , a dutch-british-scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned .
perhaps this is a little worrying .
i hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the commission and parliament is on the way to being resolved .
we must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one .
as mr blak said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .
first of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .
codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough .
there need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentralised , what may be outsourced and what is independent .
what we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the eu , for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states .
these are what are missing .
we have asked for a public prosecutor ' s office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the eu .
we should make a good deal of progress if the commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
the van hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing roles .
the court of auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .
it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .
we do not hunt down criminals. that is olaf ' s job .
tell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .
mr president , i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
i am pleased that i can address him now in dutch , now that mr van den berg has just done so .
otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .
i am from the social committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic .
i think that this is also the case here , but i think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee is mr pomés ruiz , who is spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective .
mr president , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .
a very important proposal indeed .
i am only very surprised that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by mrs morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
i do not know whether this is to appease mr kinnock , but i happen to know mr kinnock .
he is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .
in my opinion , such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .
finally , the issue of officials .
actually , i do not entirely share mr haarder ' s view .
i do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .
first of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised .
secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
for example , we are currently looking into taos. this is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the commission .
these two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other , and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .
mr president , ever since plato ' s ' republic ' , the western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .
our parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .
this lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .
the van hulten report started out as a brilliant one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieved .
unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .
mr president , mr van hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and i believe this is important in a first report .
please therefore accept what i am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .
this report seems to me to be redundant , long-winded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .
perhaps ' redundant ' is the most serious epithet , and you are not responsible for this .
it is the responsibility of this parliament .
clearly we are awaiting this reform from the commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the commission is going to make to us and this parliament will have to express its opinion on them .
meanwhile , we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence .
' long-winded ' .
i am not going to mention the length of this report .
i do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .
it is also ' confusing ' .
i am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning parliament .
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
and finally , mr president , frankly , i am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .
mr president , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are .
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .
hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by commissioners prodi and kinnock in plenary and in the committee on budgetary control .
the concept of transparency stands out in the report .
securing this is a major priority .
the importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .
this is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .
we must win back their faith in eu politics .
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them .
this is what enables them to understand what is going on. they want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served
whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the commission ' s own initiative .
however , it annoyed me when i heard today that the commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with parliament on an informal basis .
i believe , mr kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .
so if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this house .
mr president , may i begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what i hear , the pains-accepting work of mr van hulten in preparing his report .
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary .
when this house considered the second report of the committee of experts last september , i pledged on behalf of the incoming commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the commission 's reform proposals .
i am sure that mr pomes ruiz is encouraged by that .
there is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which i have had the honour to compile .
the considered view of this parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .
i would say to mr elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .
hence the transmission .
this is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this house , but more generally to the european public .
naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .
i have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .
that most certainly is the intention of the commission .
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .
as the house knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the union 's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .
several members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate .
we share the view , forcefully expressed by the committee of independent experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .
the means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the financial regulation in april .
parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
i share the view expressed by mrs theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .
change in the law is fundamental .
that service will open on 1 may this year .
it will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits .
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .
the proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big bang approach " .
financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .
i am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the committee of independent experts .
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .
it was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
in addition , i do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the court of auditors in 1997 .
naturally the court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the financial regulation but it is useful to recall mr karlsson ' s comments to this house last month .
" the commission 's internal control " he said " is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .
for instance , the financial controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .
at the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same financial controller , the inspectorate general and by some units operating directorates-general . "
the centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .
i do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .
i take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable members will see when they read the reform strategy document .
our objective , the committee ' s objective , the court of auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control .
before leaving this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong-doing .
since june of last year , the olaf regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .
we propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .
the possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .
we are seeking to implement best practice .
as a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .
a communication later this year will give full details .
i do not think parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .
i am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of parliament .
a communication in june will set out the full proposal for change .
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house .
with the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .
that is in line with the draft resolution .
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .
i welcome parliament 's support for that .
we are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of mr van hulten 's report .
the draft resolution rightly recalls the commission 's accountability to this parliament .
president prodi and vice-president de palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the commission 's practical commitment to that .
i hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .
the point was very properly raised by mr elles and referred to by mrs thors .
i am sure they are aware that in mid-december we officially received the draft framework agreement with parliament .
we are now waiting for parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
i also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
while the reform strategy white paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house .
it is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .
the early thoughts of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
i conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the house relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .
that is most certainly relevant .
we are sure that there will be an important " reform dividend " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .
it is very clear , however , that parts of the commission services are already very stretched .
parliament has frequently made that point .
secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .
thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .
they are already having implications for resource availability .
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .
the commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of mr van hulten 's report .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m. )
middle east peace process ( continuation )
the next item is the continuation of the council and commission statements on the middle east peace process .
such is life .
i hope that honourable members will excuse me if i am not able to stay to the end of the debate as i would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .
the debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis i had arranged to see visitors from the balkans this evening .
so i hope i can count on the understanding of the house on this occasion .
it is not something , i assure you , which i would wish to make a practice of .
there is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track .
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east .
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm el-sheikh memorandum .
although there has been some slippage , i trust that the remaining israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon .
i was reassured that this was also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat , when they met on monday .
honourable members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .
this is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the us and russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties .
we are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
the beginning of the talks with syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month .
i look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .
the european union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - palestinians , israelis , their arab neighbours and the united states - have acknowledged .
nor is our role confined to that of banker .
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive middle east peace deal comes with a hefty price tag .
the commission is already considering the implications for the european union of the recent encouraging developments .
we intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with parliament and council soon .
but let me remind honourable members that the european union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process .
we are the largest of all donors to the palestinians .
we have also offered very substantial support to jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt .
with the israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .
the community contribution of over eur 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the west bank and gaza .
european union member states together contributed another eur 860 million during that crucial period .
in this context , let me applaud the important steps that the palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .
president arafat will be meeting the council of ministers next week .
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .
the commission is actively involved in those efforts .
the commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between israelis and arabs .
we committed more than eur 20 million for such projects last year .
this package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where israelis and arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels .
members will recall that the european union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the middle east .
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern lebanon , the only middle eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts .
we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in lebanon as a whole .
a solution is needed to the palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .
we must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region 's very scarce water resources .
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .
i want to underline that point .
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide .
i hope i can add that we will want to provide that .
we have made progress in recent months and weeks , as mr gama mentioned earlier .
but it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way .
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .
i hope the house will understand that .
mr president , commissioner patten has our understanding .
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , i hope to see him there soon .
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
i honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
in this sense , i share commissioner patten ' s positive attitude .
let me explain : it is true that the israeli government has delayed the third hand-over of west bank territory to the palestinian authorities .
this is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as prime minister barak has promised .
i would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist .
there is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the president of the european parliament to the region will contribute to this .
mr president , i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account .
i should like to say that i agree with the tone which galeote quecedo ' s speech set here .
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process .
it is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
if we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .
i want to emphasise four points .
first of all , the sharm el-sheikh agreement contains , as everyone knows , a concrete timetable for the implementation of israel ' s commitments .
this applies both to the interim agreement and to the hebron and wye agreements .
while the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , i think it is important to keep the two processes apart .
a lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements .
the second point relates to syria .
there , the border question is obviously central .
how negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .
what is important , however , is that they have begun .
an important question in this context is the future distribution of water .
as things are at present , the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel 's water supply .
the third aspect is the peace negotiations in syria which are closely linked to the issue of israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon .
according to unifil , there are now concrete signs that israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .
there too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugees .
my last point concerns the future palestinian state .
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without israel ' s support .
the barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .
even if negotiations are not completed by september of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date .
this is something to which we all want to contribute .
more specifically , however , i would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , israel and syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east .
it is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .
indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the israeli borders , as well as syria ' s integrity .
it is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .
nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the european union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union ' s common foreign and security policy .
this is where mr solana , the high representative to the council , could come into his own .
the commission and member states also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
in this respect , we support libya ' s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .
there are still , needless to say , many unresolved problems and unanswered questions , also involving the palestinians .
mr president , it is pleasing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between israel and palestine and between israel and syria .
the moment of truth is approaching .
is israel prepared to comply with the un ' s resolutions and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the arab areas which were conquered in 1967 ?
will israel let palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan ?
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
will syria fully accept israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , israel , does not prevent the arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .
peace in the middle east concerns us all , however .
it is therefore good that the eu should act as a godparent to the palestinian state .
against this background , i want to conclude with a remarkable story from sweden where an international intergovernmental conference on hitler ' s extermination of the jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .
of 47 states invited from all corners of the world , not one of them , however , is an arab state included in the eu ' s barcelona process .
this has been interpreted as indicating that the arab attitude towards israel should be regarded by europeans as being similar to the nazis ' anti-semitism , which of course is completely incorrect .
the arab world ' s criticism of israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , algeria ' s fight for freedom against france .
but today , egypt , jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel .
i therefore wonder whether commissioner patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one arab state to the holocaust conference in stockholm .
it is high time there was peace in the middle east. it is time to end the era which began with the balfour declaration in 1917 and the arab-israeli war of 1948 .
i refer principally to the palestine-israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since 1967 and in southern lebanon since 1982 .
however , israel is not the only country concerned with security .
between the period when the oslo agreement was signed and 17 october 1999 , 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated , 8 462 of which have been taken under mr barak ' s government .
trees have been uprooted , houses are still being demolished and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in east jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .
nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed .
but in the middle east , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .
all the international community has to do is implement resolutions 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .
we are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with syria , as well as mr barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the israeli army and the sharm el ­ -sheikh agreements .
we feel it is extremely important for the european union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .
we cannot be content with a role backstage. we must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the united states , as minister gama said .
i was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between israel and syria had been suspended .
i very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .
nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the middle east of late .
political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the middle east .
i know that if agreement can be reached between syria and israel , the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum .
the settlers at the golan heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .
if syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the israel / syria question might be promising .
on the issue of palestine , i recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the wye agreement .
the key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territories .
these issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , i believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .
currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .
mr president , the various motions for resolutions tabled in parliament more or less represent the situation in the middle east .
there are those who are in favour of new agreements between israel and syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the middle east issue .
indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
mr president , the israeli author , amos oz , managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the israelis and syrians recently .
he was under the impression that the syrians thought that , in exchange for the golan heights , all they had to do was to fax the israelis a receipt .
oz ' s impression is also echoed in the israeli press .
it contrasts prime minister barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of damascus , president assad , at the negotiations in the united states .
surely assad would be barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the foreign affairs minister .
and the israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of minister farouk al-shara in shepherdstown .
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak was plainly insulting .
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?
well , the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .
at the end of the day , israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the golan .
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process .
i would like to finish off by asking the european council and commission a question .
how accurate are the press reports which state that the portuguese presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the golan ?
the suspension of the talks between syria and israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east .
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment .
what can the european union do in these circumstances ?
unfortunately , very little .
when we consider that a conference will soon be held in moscow , it becomes clear that the european union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful .
i should just like to make three comments which commissioner patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a member can formulate more openly .
first , i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authorities .
but we have enough agreements now : oslo , wye plantation , sharm el-sheikh .
we have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .
my second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between syria and israel .
i consider this to be very encouraging news .
but we have also learned this week that mr barak will not be travelling to washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .
i should like to make it quite clear : if the golan heights are returned to syria , the problem in this region will be solved .
that would be a similar situation .
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union .
you know that you will always have our support here in parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
this hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. we hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders .
all the foreign troops , including therefore the syrian forces , must withdraw from lebanon in accordance with resolution 520 of the united nations security council .
dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july 2000 , the date promised by ehud barak ?
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbours to the north ?
we really hope and believe so .
never have the parties been so determined .
following the attack in hadera on monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
at midday , mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region .
despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of washington .
like other arab countries before them , the syrians chose the americans to sponsor the negotiations .
this was the choice also made by israel where europe suffers from a partisan public image , and this is a fact , not a judgement .
this is now the opportunity to reiterate to mr patten , mr solana and mr moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
although it is difficult for europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .
area of freedom , security and justice
mr president , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , of the communitisation of the schengen agreement and of the extraordinary tampere council .
these have been the most important moments in the council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .
it has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework .
they have been put into the hands of a single commissioner , mr antonio vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .
it is as if the council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other begrudges .
despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .
programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this parliament is unable to do so .
we have presented the council with a series of questions and i know that it is the will of the portuguese presidency to answer each and every one of them .
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament .
i said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the council and the policies actually carried out .
there are doubts in my group and doubts also persist in this house , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the schengen agreement into the community framework .
schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .
the same is true with regard to immigration policy .
we have amused ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .
we hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament .
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union .
the council can act in accordance with parliament ' s decisions , or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project .
if it chooses the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .
alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .
we are all aware that , to this end , it is essential for the council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which commissioner vitorino has the remit of establishing .
i must stress once again the portuguese presidency ' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal council in lisbon on 3 and 4 march .
and i must not forget the finnish presidency ' s proposal for a council decision which is being considered in the multi-disciplinary group .
our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the european parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .
the french presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol .
for this reason , it is essential that the council ' s debates on the future of europol and eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .
we are familiar with parliament ' s views and we know that parliament is aware of the views of the council ' s legal advisers .
in this first speech , i would like to share with parliament the commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .
i believe that i can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the union on issues of freedom , security and justice .
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union .
the union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at tampere .
1999 was also marked by the german presidency ' s initiative to draw up a european charter of fundamental rights .
in addition to these events , i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .
the commission made an active contribution to the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and ultimately , in december , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a european refugee fund .
we also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment .
in the field of european union legislation on combating financial crime , the commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .
in 1999 , the commission also presented its contribution towards a european action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the helsinki european council .
it will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the european union ' s institutions towards the public .
it is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .
in the coming weeks , i shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs .
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .
and we hope , during the portuguese presidency , to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council , taking account of the soundings that i have just mentioned .
it is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .
i also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , alimony claims and non-contested claims .
as a follow-up to the tampere and helsinki conclusions , the commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a european union strategy to combat organised crime .
we will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .
the commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .
we are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime .
the recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on article 62 of the treaty .
lastly , i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam .
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself .
as i have told parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .
commissioner vitorino , although i would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the council has demonstrated towards us .
minister gomes , i have , of course , heard what you have said and i hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the portuguese presidency .
i should like to raise three points which for us , as members of the ppe group , must be focal points when such an area is created .
first : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed .
the council must start by at long last ensuring that eurodac is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers .
as far as a european asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at vienna and tampere .
unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .
i therefore call on the council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole union .
similarly , it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
secondly : the introduction of a europe-wide fight against organised crime , including by europol and eurojust .
the planned introduction of eurojust is one of our significant successes from tampere and must now be implemented forthwith .
we welcome the fact that europol has finally been able to start work .
we are not just calling for more control , and more control over europol ; our motto here is " less is sometimes more ! "
with most of europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control .
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament , without hampering the work of europol .
at the same time , we support the establishment of a european police academy as suggested in tampere as a step in the right direction .
thirdly : the extension to parliament ' s rights in this context .
there is therefore an urgent need to grant parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of europe , not against them .
mr president , i have nothing further to say to the council .
the previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all !
why does the council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom , security and justice ?
i find this question more and more worrying .
allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view .
the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty .
so we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available .
as a result , the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need , also realise that , in implementing this , they are taking away their own powers .
then there is the european parliament , which is also complicated .
it has not quite taken off in the european parliament and the council meets behind closed doors .
if the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice is kept secret , then we shall not win the citizens over to it .
in other words , the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it .
this is why i frequently get so worked up , but not over the council of ministers .
generally , they too are elected members of parliament : mr gomes , mr costa , commissioner vitorino , in principle we are all in the same boat .
however , i should like to make an appeal to the council apparatchiks .
the following principle applies : he who prepares decisions , in this case the council apparatchiks , anticipates the decisions , which is why the council apparatchiks should demonstrate more democratic spirit .
i should just like to mention another aspect briefly because i do not have much time .
scoreboard sounds like skateboard in german .
i say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented , when and by whom .
this vitorino plan is what we need : clear , precise projects with a clear , defined timetable .
mr vitorino , whom i would like to thank for his speech , can give us that , provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources .
let us give him those resources , then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain .
i warmly welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown .
i was also encouraged by commissioner patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .
perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in kosovo the police they promised .
i just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .
the first is asylum .
it is essential to establish a single european system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the geneva convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .
decisions on asylum should take months - not years .
let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .
the last area i want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .
eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on .
arrested and released in madrid , he is now being extradited after arrest in lisbon .
whatever the eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and i hope that the igc will cover this , to move to codecision with the european parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .
mr president , all i can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the portuguese summer after the finnish winter .
i hope that it works out .
the tampere summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
numerous questions are still outstanding .
answers are still awaited .
since tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .
on the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .
the creation of a charter of fundamental rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .
however , it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the union .
the europol agreement has now officially entered into force .
in tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
the agreement also attracts criticism with regard to eurodac .
parliament has amended the contractual text .
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament ' s modus operandi .
unfortunately , no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them .
europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .
and yet we owe this to the citizens of europe .
having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , i am optimistic and i am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this .
we are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .
this is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .
for europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
a proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movements .
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable .
all asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect .
last week , and somewhat by chance , i witnessed , at roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , admittedly illegal immigrants , were being returned to conakry .
they were treated like the worst criminals .
they were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair , surrounded by a horde of state security police .
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour .
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed .
instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .
the presidency and the council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .
likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action .
the laws against racism must be harmonised .
what direction do you intend to give to article 13 of the ec treaty ?
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?
how do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ?
we must take the best from each of our countries .
in more general terms , this presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .
immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers ?
mr president , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
the european union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees .
the level of racism in our society is terrifying .
racism in ireland is endemic .
it has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the european union for a long time .
we are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .
there is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in ireland but throughout the european union .
and our current eu mantra is afsj : area for freedom , security and justice .
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .
and who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
the problem is just that this is not something the eu can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions .
freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .
a system of this kind is not something the eu can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .
but it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .
that is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .
the agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the eu ' s control .
it is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a duplicitous package , involves increased repression and control .
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning fort europa , schengen , eurodac etc .
any democrat can spot two key problems .
first of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .
how is it envisaged that the eu ' s institutions , which are already stretched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition ?
think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the commission ' s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .
it also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .
but , secondly , the projects will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracies .
as long as the eu revolved around the internal market , only the body was being attacked .
now , it is the soul .
mr president , today the people of northern ireland see a strange irony .
let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .
in 1998 , we had 55 murders .
in 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .
between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .
charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 .
mr president , that situation cannot continue and needs remedying .
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union .
this is a task which all meps , the council and the commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .
the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country , spain , and in belgium , are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .
my third and final point relates to the external activities of the union in the field of immigration and asylum .
we must not and cannot give the impression that the union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .
finally , in relation to the charter of fundamental rights , the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
the euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
they need a ' european soul ' , as a distinguished spanish professor once said .
mr president , unlike some of the previous speakers , i want to go back to the words of our portuguese ministers and mr vitorino .
this trio 's words were like music to our ears as mr ceyhun has said .
as with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated .
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .
the tune that will be played will be one that the people of europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
as described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the european election and over the last few months .
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .
one area though is extremely important , and this house must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .
and we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .
i should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about .
but the commission and council must know that there are many people in this house who have reservations about the eurodac system , for example .
mr schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' .
anyone who is english or british or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is .
a scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible .
i am sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that is so .
at the end of six months i hope that the music is still playing and that the european people are still listening .
amsterdam and tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by mrs terrón today shows .
i would like to make three brief points .
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament .
let us stop the shadow-boxing .
let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .
involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .
let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .
my second point is that we need a properly resourced commission .
we have established a new directorate-general , yet it has only 70 people all told .
there is an agreement to double this number , but i understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .
we are setting the commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs .
finally , on the content of the debate , i welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
all good things come in threes , especially in our policy area .
two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .
although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .
the role of the court of justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .
the unilateral decision by belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political rights of all european residents is to be regretted .
although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .
we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements .
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non-refoulement ' [ no turning back ] .
furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the council by a procedure without debate and without consulting parliament .
however , the main concern remains ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the council as well as the commissioner .
i thank them for their statements to the house .
i look to the portuguese presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the finnish presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the member states .
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty .
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on 23 december .
mr president , esteemed gentlemen from portugal , especially the council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
i refer to eurodac .
we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .
even in tampere , we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
my urgent request on behalf of the group is that you do everything to ensure that eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
mr president , ministers , commissioner , the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich , so much so that it became difficult to gather , i.e. to put those decisions into practice .
i refer in particular to the council and to the inertia of the member states in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .
from what i have said , it must be obvious to you that the european parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
how do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the community , reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of europe ?
in light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the un , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?
i have great expectations for the portuguese presidency .
mr president , i welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .
but i want to add a word of caution .
there are also courts in karlsruhe , london , lisbon , dublin and edinburgh .
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .
but we must look always to subsidiarity .
like everybody in this house , i want freedom , justice and security .
i do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would very quickly like to make one point. various members raised questions about the portuguese presidency .
( sustained applause )
thank you , minister .
the debate is closed .
mr president , i am grateful for the council ' s oral , and also written , reply .
their efficiency has been truly remarkable .
i will save a few seconds because i wanted to propose to the council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the committee on citizens ' rights and freedoms , justice and home affairs .
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the commission as well .
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .
representatives of the council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament .
question time ( council )
the next item is question time ( b5-0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the council .
question no 1 by ( h-0780 / 99 ) :
mr president , the council wishes to point out that turkey is a signatory to the convention on nuclear safety , the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by mr souladakis .
the convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .
thank you for your answer .
however , i would just like to add the following. turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
nevertheless , rumour has it that it plans to buy candu reactors of the type acquired by pakistan and india which were used for nuclear weapons .
in this respect , the issue requires closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the caucasus region could heighten people ' s suspicions .
my second point concerns the safety of these plants .
however , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .
with this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .
in this respect , and because turkey is situated on the periphery of the european union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .
that is our role and this is the point of my question .
i recognise the relevance of the arguments that mr souladakis has put forward .
this is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
furthermore , it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect turkey , in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the european union .
it also affects other states neighbouring the eu with which we maintain relations .
this question will naturally be one of our key concerns , and the european commission will not fail to take this into account .
thank you , mr president and thank you president-in-office of the council .
i am sure the president-in-office of the council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog .
however , forgive me if i am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .
i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately .
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
however , i would like to say , mr newton dunn , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .
we therefore consider that the general secretariat of the council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the council ' s functions as a legislative body .
i do not consider that the council tried to answer my question .
i did not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission has still not tabled. instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of article 255 of the treaty of amsterdam .
does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the european union referred to there ?
i should like to have an answer to that question .
does the council consider that , on the basis of article 255 of the treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the eu ' s institutions ?
mr sjöstedt , the answer that i gave was the only answer possible .
nevertheless , i would like to say that any interpretation of article 255 of the treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .
at the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .
in any event , article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
does not the council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
mrs frahm , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last intergovernmental conference .
i would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the community institutions " outwards " , it also applies between the institutions .
as a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference .
the matter is still open .
i believe that the commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but i think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .
for our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .
it is a very important question indeed which jonas sjöstedt and others have asked .
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .
we are very anxious indeed that the eu , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the treaty of amsterdam .
one or two years ago , parliament adopted a report by mrs lööw which is extremely important in this context .
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the member states .
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament .
i want to ask the council if it understands this warning , in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the commission .
i listened very carefully to what mr seixas da costa had to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference .
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference , which would mean widening the agenda .
mr dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .
it is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the european agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference .
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
as far as we are concerned , they will be .
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
question no 5 by ( h-0785 / 99 ) :
does the council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established tac of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?
what measures does the council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
the council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refers .
it was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .
as for the southern stocks of anchovy in ices zone ix , the tac was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .
fishing quota transfers between portugal and france were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in french waters .
i would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole community fishing area .
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stocks of anchovy in the bay of biscay are allocated to spain and only 10 % to france .
without this transfer from portuguese waters , the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to france .
that is why i think that this is quite positive from portugal ' s point of view .
this situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by mr ortuondo larrea , which we also understand .
mr president-in-office of the council , i must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .
i understand that portugal is affected by this .
today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay is in danger of extinction , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that bay .
the court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to spain in zone viii had been maintained at 90 % and france ' s at 10 % .
accordingly , mr ortuondo larrea , the council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of france ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay .
the council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .
in concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5 % of portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9 % in 1999 .
question no 6 by ( h-0788 / 99 ) :
in the light of the above , will the council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of kosovo , as requested by parliament ?
what other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?
mr alavanos , i would like to say that i have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .
the council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts .
it will not be tolerated , and must stop immediately .
it has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-albanian minorities are treated .
i think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the european union ' s position , is being maintained by the council and will continue to be maintained .
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .
kfor and the unmic police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin .
i would like to thank mr president-in-office of the council .
i believe - as i think we all do - that portugal , its former president , mr soares , and its government , maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the balkans .
today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which i welcome .
however , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union .
unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradication of serb , romany , turkish , and croatian minorities in kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next .
mr alavanos , i cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on mr kouchner ' s responsibilities , and i would like to make two very important points here .
the structure being implemented in kosovo is under the auspices of the united nations .
it is a structure to which the european union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the european union have contributed in various ways .
therefore , the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context .
these are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the united nations .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
we have endeavoured to provide material help .
we have tried to defend peace by taking military action .
what is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
mr rübig , as i said , i understand your concerns very well .
the issue which we should all raise , and i did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of security council resolution 12 / 99 .
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented. we advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency .
mr seixas da costa , i totally agree with you .
the problem is not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely resolution 1244 .
it is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and assassinations mentioned by mr alavanos .
does the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo ?
since the author is not present , question no 7 lapses .
question no 8 by ( h-0796 / 99 ) :
however , housing is specifically excluded .
through the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund , the eaggf , this community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas , an issue you are quite right to raise .
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the erdf also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .
question no 9 by ( h-0798 / 99 ) :
the portuguese presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and i think that the portuguese foreign minister and president-in-office already referred to this aspect this morning .
we think that the role of food safety , specifically in terms of everything linked to public health , is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks .
it is therefore one of the priorities of our programme .
this is what we shall be trying to achieve during the portuguese presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this house .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i completely understand your concerns , and i feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue .
we also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .
nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the european commission and it will have to take this further .
the council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .
mr president , i too would like to welcome the president-in-office to the chamber .
i feel this is one area where europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the member states .
mr president-in-office of the council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the commission will do , and what the presidency will do in lisbon , etc .
however , you also said something which i find particularly frightening .
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
i am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .
i do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .
i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters .
you must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .
i think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .
one of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion .
the second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the european union , and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion .
the portuguese presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .
it is prepared to act on proposals by the commission in any area for which there is community competence .
we will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .
question no 12 by ( h-0801 / 99 ) :
subject : portuguese presidency and development policy will the president-in-office of the council make a statement on the priorities of the portuguese presidency with regard to development policy , the convention of lomé and tackling famine situations ?
i would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the minister who spoke to the committee on development last week in brussels outlining the position .
but there are some questions still outstanding .
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aids in the programme .
the situation of aids in africa now is so serious that more people are dying of aids than are dying in conflict .
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
medicines are available in the united states but the united states is not making them cheap enough for the people in africa .
at the same time , there is a war going on between eritrea and ethiopia and the armaments industry in europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread .
first of all , mr andrews , you must understand that i do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the committee on development .
there is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .
as you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
all we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .
we must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes .
indeed , in terms of development aid policy , i think that europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the united states .
is the council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the eu to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?
does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
since the author is not present , question no 13 lapses .
i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council , and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency .
please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on european affairs .
unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer .
since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is , i am afraid , just an excuse .
this is a true example of the council ' s indifference towards culture , despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance .
i would therefore like to ask the council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas , hops , cows and indian hemp .
mr marinos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the portuguese presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , i am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .
this is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the world trade organisation .
but , mr marinos , in the eu context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with igc agendas .
of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the intergovernmental conference , there might eventually be progress .
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .
mr president , i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
i notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next igc but if some people wished it , you would consider it .
well , i , and my fellow 35 british conservative meps wish it and would like you to please consider it .
i appreciate that it is a provocative question .
it is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold eu law in the respect which it deserves .
we have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens .
i cannot think of a better way to do it .
can you ?
the issue is whether the european dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the treaties .
intergovernmental conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree .
it is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .
mr dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .
i would ask him to be brief .
mr president , i understand that i have to do this very quickly .
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas .
in spain they say a letter to the three kings .
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .
now the presidency and the council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings .
as i suspected , it was not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate .
we thank mr seixas da costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .
the problem is that in this case father christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .
it is not the portuguese presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the european parliament is asking for .
after this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the rules of procedure , i would like to tell you that questions nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .
that concludes questions to the council .
capital tax
the next item is the joint debate on :
the oral question ( b5-0004 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the council , on the council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question ( b5-0005 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the commission , on the commission position on the idea of a capital tax .
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .
yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunging its whole population into recession .
in view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by james tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transactions .
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .
many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the brazilian president , fernando cardoso , the finnish government , the canadian parliament last march and also lionel jospin in 1995 .
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu .
i am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the gue / ngl , greens / efa , eldr and pse groups .
one of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be said of any tax .
if this argument had been accepted in the past , then no taxes would ever have been created .
the motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the commission and council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the imf .
the european union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the g7 because it is primarily a political question .
madam president , i do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
the council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as professor tobin suggested .
as it falls to the commission to propose any such initiative , the council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .
madam president , the revenue basis of the tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions .
such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables .
this has also just been underlined by mr désir .
taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams , even a low nominal tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue .
in reality , the motive underlying the increased interest in the tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic .
indeed , it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by .
the commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .
mr désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .
but if the tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .
put more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens .
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .
for the reasons set out above , i cannot see a good reason for introducing a european tobin tax .
at any rate , the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union .
in more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams , this would contravene the treaty of rome .
madam president , commissioner , i should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .
also because i know how many social democrats in this house share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy experts .
we know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .
the tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the eea in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east asian currencies in 1997 .
in my view , and i say this quite clearly , the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused .
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?
first , and the commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .
even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .
secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .
thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes .
fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .
we need stronger banking supervision .
we need to clarify the liability for transactions .
we need a framework of regulations at international level .
we need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands .
i refer to point 9 .
having listened to the commissioner just now , we know that the commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a ' no ' to the tobin tax .
the capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .
madam president , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one .
we have been discussing the tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is .
we must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .
it is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .
this is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal .
i will have to repeat these arguments , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .
firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets .
furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .
this is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical viability .
i suppose that the first thing they say will be , ' let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the union ' .
in itself , globalisation is positive .
the economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .
this is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .
any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political colour or orientation .
as i have said , we are not opposed to such a study .
madam president , commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .
the main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .
in this respect , mr bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the tobin tax .
secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely european initiative .
there should be no confusion in this debate. as environmentalists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .
although a study produced by the commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
this argument is therefore not relevant .
i will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .
however , i would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .
we clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the international monetary fund .
we therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the commission and council appear before parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .
obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .
having said this , our group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. this invites the commission to present a report within six months .
usd 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets. this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .
by putting finance at the helm , this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere .
it has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .
unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .
openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in asia , russia and brazil .
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .
in this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the tobin tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .
this tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy .
the commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this .
in any case , the european parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .
madam president , i too am delighted that we are having this debate. i only regret that it has been so long in coming .
our world is now dominated by a single logic or , i could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .
it was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible .
yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies , both individuals and states .
this is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of states .
if the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the tobin tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
it is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .
there should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the g7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved .
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .
with regard to the tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation .
for that reason , as mr karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .
this again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .
although it seems a reasonable scheme , the tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which i do not believe there will .
it has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
for that reason , the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .
hence , as mr karas has stated to his credit , our group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the tobin tax .
madam president , i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .
it seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .
the size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .
computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .
mr chirac has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy .
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders .
of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .
europe , japan and the us - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
i am disappointed in the epp .
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
yes , i am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .
what we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
the tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the uk , according to a recent survey by war on want .
in france it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the third world out of its debt and poverty .
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament , the council or the commission .
there is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : " it has not been done before " .
madam president , commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules .
i have two or three points to make in this respect .
one of the main demands of the demonstrators in seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .
the proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich european countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism .
everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. the members on the right should note this .
it symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in africa , the caribbean and the pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in seattle .
in order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries .
this is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .
we cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares .
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly .
it has been demonstrated in germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6 % of overall economic income since tobin developed his idea .
we cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations .
nor do i believe that this is impracticable .
why should it not be possible for the g7 countries , the other eu member states , china , singapore and switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the tobin tax ?
there must be an overriding economic interest .
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive .
madam president , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as mr karas put it just a few minutes ago .
we are looking for solutions .
of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .
he recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the european union 's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .
we citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .
to continue would be economic suicide .
honourable members , commissioner , it is often said that europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector , but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .
the fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .
speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious .
over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .
the danger is too great for us to ignore .
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .
that is what we are lacking , commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .
madam president , mr bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .
we needed a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax means .
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
that the right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into switzerland .
we all know that !
but now i call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital .
it has never been done in south-east asia , it has never been done in europe , and i can understand why mr karas from austria has left the chamber , given austria ' s financial record .
they are all tarred with the same dirty brush !
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
madam president , i am totally appalled by the commission ' s , i.e. mr bolkestein ' s , political ignorance !
he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all !
madam president , i too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .
those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested .
we have asset inflation of global proportions .
as a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy .
and it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .
we can take action against this ; it is possible .
the minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout europe .
that too is feasible .
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble !
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .
the fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large european banks here at home must not be ignored .
madam president , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .
the tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .
who is going to defend these speculators , when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?
article 73 c of the treaty establishing the european union provides scope for taxation on transactions .
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .
the union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .
the low rate tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems .
it is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .
the european union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .
the truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .
in the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative elite have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system .
madam president , may i begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , mr désir , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .
whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it is evident that it is an important one .
this is why it has been around for years , and it is satisfying that the commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response .
i would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the member of your parliament , mr gasòliba .
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and i share his view .
a second remark made by mr gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .
i think that he is correct in this regard .
i too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates .
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why i am reiterating them here .
madam president , could i furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the european union on the other ?
surely we are all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .
madam president , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the tobin tax , as already underlined by mr karas and other speakers .
it has unfortunately been observed , i have to say , that the european union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures .
this indicates how difficult these dossiers are .
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally , i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .
i think that this will be problematic .
madam president , mr jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets .
in order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .
is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in english ' good governance ' ?
is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?
that the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?
that is not always the case .
so if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .
in addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by mr gasòliba i böhm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .
more supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the imf .
madam president , according to various members of your parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .
for example , mr kreissl-dörfler spoke in english about ' long-term capital for long-term projects ' - this is an obvious issue .
madam president , i should like to leave it here .
i have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .
madam president , unfortunately i do not have your mastery of the french language .
but i would be obliged if mr bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which i think he cannot do at the same time as talking to mrs randzio-plath .
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him ?
monsieur bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose !
unfortunately , my dutch is not as good as yours .
but i would rather like to say something else to you .
parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a tobin type tax just to annoy the commission .
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax .
it will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .
from a political point of view , i always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things !
it is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .
it also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this parliament .
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
we can do so without going off at other tangents. i respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the tobin tax !
madam president , an omission appears to have been made .
mr désir , i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
if the services of the presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12.00 p.m.
( the sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m. )
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr president , i simply wanted to pass on some news. there was a terrorist attack this morning in madrid .
someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .
on behalf of my group , i once again condemn these terrorist acts .
thank you , mrs fraga estévez .
we had heard about this regrettable incident .
unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing spanish society. i note your comments with particular keenness , as you may expect , given that i too am spanish .
( the minutes were approved )
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 21 january 2000 .
madam president , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the cermis tragedy .
mrs angelilli , thank you. i have taken note of your comment .
agenda
the next item is the order of business .
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from mr seixas da costa , president-in-office of the council , and mr romano prodi , president of the commission .
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
madam president , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule 50 of our rules of procedure .
this debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .
( applause )
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
if you ratify ...
mr gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rules of procedure are observed .
madam president , i thought i had three minutes .
do forgive me .
topical and urgent debate
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
talks in austria on forming a government
the next item is the debate on the talks in austria on forming a government .
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa , president-in-office of the council .
madam president , president of the commission , president-in-office of the council , the group of the party of european socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the european public .
let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .
in any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the austrian freedom party .
i will say one thing. for many years i was a traitor to my country ; at least that was general franco ' s view .
president guterres was also a traitor in salazar ' s eyes , and that is something that i believe should also be stated and defended by the ppe-de .
i also believe that the commission , or president prodi , has acted as a guardian of the treaties .
however , i would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the commission as a european government .
a government must have more nerve and more courage .
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment .
( applause )
secondly , madam president , we wish to send a very clear message to the austrian people .
we should not be so politically partisan .
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture .
we all took part in it , not just one group .
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence .
we support the council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .
( applause from the pse group )
madam president , my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment .
this is the first time in the history of the modern european project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right .
that is deeply disturbing .
the fpö contends that if one reads their literature and their programme , there is much in it that one could share .
that may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we liberal democrats had with the austrian fpö in our liberal international family .
as early as 1986 , we had cause to believe that mr jörg haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism .
in november of 1991 , after a long internal debate in liberal international and many visits to vienna to discuss issues , we suspended the fpö from membership and in july 1993 we expelled them .
we expelled them then and we continue to reject what mr haider stands for now .
let me share what we learned in that long experience .
there were many in our ranks who said " read the text " .
there were many more in our ranks who said " read the subtext " , " look at the context " .
words in politics can be incendiary , can be inflammatory , or can be conciliatory .
we found that mr jörg haider , as a wordsmith , has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia .
he is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability .
that is why this debate is important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism , something profound is happening in europe today .
( applause )
i hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the austrian people .
we respect the rights of the austrian people to their own democratic process .
every right-thinking person in this house believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour , class or creed .
we must promote and defend those rights , all the while saying to the people of austria : our quarrel is not with you .
i wish to say with regard to the initiative of the portuguese presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it .
it may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept mr president-in-office , that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it .
i share with president prodi a preference for the community method and we must look at article 6 and article 7 of the treaty .
article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values .
we must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance .
then we can work together by the community method to root out this cancer within our midst .
i want to say madame president some words to mr schüssel .
mr schüssel is a man with an honourable record in european politics .
he now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger .
mr schüssel - you are assuming a very serious , personal , national and european responsibility .
that responsibility , which you mr schüssel now take on , is to respect the letter and the spirit of the european treaties .
finally , madame president , this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance .
it is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this union that we will not as europeans countenance turning the clock back .
( loud applause )
madam president , in my group ' s opinion , the european union today faces a political and ethical challenge which is without precedent since the creation of the union .
the european union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a member state government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the union .
however , with haider and his men , we would see the extreme right , openly racist , anti-semitic and xenophobic , promoted to the rank of co-ruler of our community .
going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testifying , albeit unwillingly , to the respectability of a political force which is not respectable .
of course , there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of austria .
any action which can be taken must , in our opinion , serve the twofold function of proscribing haider without , however , isolating austrian society .
democrats in this country now need our support more than ever .
the great joining of forces in protest in vienna on 12 november last year must now undergo developments suited to the new situation .
we must have dialogue with them and join forces with them , stand at their side in order to offer the people of austria some alternative prospects .
finally , we must ask ourselves : how did we come to be in this position ?
this debate is now before us , but each and every one of us , male and female , is going to assume their responsibilities without delay .
( applause )
madam president , we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the union , so that we can uphold them together .
instead , we have been forced to debate the formal , substantial errors that have been made in the last few days .
we have never before seen such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a member state .
however , up till now , austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .
apart from amounting to interference , the statement by the presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for .
sanctions can be imposed after the treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .
bilateral relations involve the states , so the 14 do not come into this .
so many things set us apart from mr haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely italian alto adige region .
however , we already knew this .
however , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the union seem to have turned their backs on the union ' s democratic role .
we support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights .
we believe in europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union .
this is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .
we have built a europe with an unstable market , not a europe with principles , rights and politics .
and these are the consequences !
madam president , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .
in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria .
there are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
we could , if one third of the members of parliament so requested , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .
( the president cut the speaker off )
madame president , my group , the edd , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .
we cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of herr haider and we deplore his references to the third reich .
we also , however , deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the european union .
my party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well .
are you going to interfere with great britain ' s parliament if we are elected ?
madame president , the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament .
i believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
your parliament , may i suggest , madame president , should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country .
then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , madame president and only then , may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union .
madam president , to begin with , i would like to make one thing abundantly clear : austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion .
austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary .
austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria .
our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .
our country was not just the first victim of the hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt .
the övp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union .
my country ' s place is not outside the european union but in it ...
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !
any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto , and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media .
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values !
( applause )
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , representatives of the commission , it is a black day for austria and for europe .
not even mr sichrovsky ' s web of lies or mrs stenzel ' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that .
for the day has dawned : two irresponsible politicians , consumed with a lust for power , are selling austria ' s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river !
( applause , heckling )
they are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .
however , my criticism - and i freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , messrs schüssel and haider and their parties , ...
... and that includes their representatives in this parliament .
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system .
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .
( applause )
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured .
that is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the övp - is sustained rather than kept in check .
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .
however , by the same token , there is another austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the fpö having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria !
( applause )
the more powerful this europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism .
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism .
please support the austrian people against this government !
( applause )
madam president , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the european union has gradually developed into a community of values .
we see this , now that the government of one member state is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .
as members of parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever .
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .
as important is the fact that austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .
we know that most austrians respect these values .
they have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria .
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time .
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy .
i also appeal to the austrian president , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .
madam president , i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , francis wurtz , reminded us of just now .
i welcome the statements by the presidency of the council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an austrian government that includes jörg haider ' s party .
this danger does not concern austria , it concerns europe .
we are talking about us , not austria .
not only the alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat .
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
europe is showing that it has not forgotten auschwitz ; europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .
this is the change we must impose on the commission ' s action .
madam president , we are debating an extremely serious issue .
we are debating nothing less than the presence in a member state ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the union enshrined in its founding treaties .
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the austrian freedom party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder .
of course austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a member state .
however , that is not the problem .
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party .
our answer to this crucial question is no .
( applause )
konrad adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you .
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .
( loud applause )
madam president , the european union was built upon the idea ' never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti-semitism , heightened nationalism or war .
it is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo-fascists somewhere in europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .
let us learn the lessons of the past .
they put their own petty squabbles first , and the rest is history .
we must make a rapid , strong and united response .
i would have liked to hear your discussion with the austrian president , mr poettering .
we are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .
so our response must be rapid and strong .
of course , the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; i was almost going to say ' irreparable ' .
and when that day comes , it is too late .
we must therefore find a political solution .
our response must be rapid .
if today we do not staunchly support the council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the munich agreement .
today , we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
madam president , this debate was opened by mr da costa , who merely confirms that the eu presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member states .
this debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the council , the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists .
my delegation of 37 conservative and unionist members from the united kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of austria ' s freedom party .
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular world war ii , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the european union itself .
we were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former ussr .
even today , surely it is high time for the party of european socialists to break their fraternal links with china ' s communist party .
this , madam president , is the hypocrisy of the left .
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the british government and the other largely socialist heads of eu governments and include that of the united states .
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results .
this requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .
that should be our task , not political posturing .
madam president , representative of the council , commissioner , a week ago , the big international holocaust conference ended in stockholm .
its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism .
secondly , i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .
we demand of the candidate states and of the countries with which the eu cooperates under the lomé agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .
that is why we are reacting against this carry-on in austria .
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union .
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously. something has happened .
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine .
madam president , as everyone has said , this is a very important day .
it is the day of the first debate of european political life .
and this is not pure chance .
i feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of europe , our institutions , with austria or mr haider ' s party .
it is the meeting of europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reasons why we are here in this chamber .
this chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .
this chamber , and the european institutions , were build to uphold values , morality and a certain spirit .
the fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of mr haider ' s party , the fpö , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .
reading only one sentence which my friend , mr vidal-quadras , has previously mentioned , " the nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . "
well , we cannot accept such statements .
( applause )
madam president , we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other members too .
the coalition which is being created in one of the member states is clearly an austrian affair but undoubtedly has a european dimension too .
because what is it that unites us in europe ?
surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .
the austrian freedom party leader , mr haider , has repeatedly repudiated these values .
he also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness .
he is a dangerous man .
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders .
values should take precedence over power .
we deplore , therefore , what is happening in austria .
in fact , we were shaken by it .
we are extremely disappointed .
as a last resort , we would ask the övp to look into alternatives .
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty .
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .
if , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the övp party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie european integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed .
madam president , austria awaits a heavy responsibility .
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the council presidency last weekend are having in austria itself ?
have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?
have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in austria in the course of the next few days ?
from all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen haider .
who would want this to happen ?
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
europe is a community of law .
democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .
it is for reasons of constitutionality that the president-in-office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the treaty .
( applause )
i am duty- bound to say to this house , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the commission on this issue .
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the president this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen member states in their statement on monday .
secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all member states in examining the situation as it develops in austria .
there is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , franz fischler .
that surely is in everyone ' s interests .
in order to ensure that the treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .
we will continue to do that , madam president , without fear or favour .
that is our duty .
it is also a matter of conviction .
my final point is this. we understand the context of this essential debate .
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism .
and , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this house , my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused .
however , the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct .
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning. that is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law .
without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people .
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as mr cox said in the debate , ' necessarily with acute vigilance ' .
does the commission support the council ?
thank you , commissioner kinnock .
i think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
recourse to the precautionary principle
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .
i want to start by saying that i am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with david byrne and erkki liikanen .
the precautionary principle is not a new concept .
it also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the rio declaration and most recently the bio-safety protocol .
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear .
however , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .
events such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .
in view of this growing interest , the commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .
the basic aim of the communication is twofold .
the commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .
of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .
as such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society .
it is therefore political by nature .
however , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .
they must be non-discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .
for example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .
all these elements have to apply cumulatively .
it is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures , which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle .
for example , a research programme , public information campaigns , recommendations and so on .
applying the precautionary principle does not , therefore , automatically imply a ban .
this communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .
mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
i have three short questions , the first being as follows .
we have been awaiting a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speaks with one voice .
does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the commissioners for industry , foreign trade , competition and the internal market ?
i am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?
my next question , mrs wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?
in other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?
. thank you very much , dagmar roth-behrendt , for these questions .
of course , this is shared by the whole commission .
this is a common communication which was written by the three of us , david byrne , erkki liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the commission today .
it received strong support from the rest of the commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the commission .
so we have really worked through this document and i am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .
yes , i would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .
and , i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
we have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft pvc toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .
it has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?
the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists .
i would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
how would you describe this ?
what establishes a recognised minority ?
if a political decision is involved , i would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
the commission ?
the council ?
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this ?
what is the role of the scientific committees ?
what , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?
these are my three questions .
. yes , mr president , that is true .
there were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but i will try to answer some questions .
who will take the decision , who are the decision-makers ?
well , that depends on who the legislators are .
this is part of risk management .
they have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .
however , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .
that is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .
it is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base .
we use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
so , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .
mr president , i have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .
it is about brominated flame retardants .
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment .
there are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .
recently , both sweden and denmark urged the commission in the council of ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants .
i am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .
.
( sv ) mr president , thank you very much , mr sjöstedt , for this question .
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken .
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .
where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .
this issue is extremely topical .
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean ?
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops .
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do ?
. ( sv ) mr president , i am pleased to be able to tell you that , in montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety .
we succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .
i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle .
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .
it is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .
mr president , i have two questions. i shall try to be very brief indeed .
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .
as i have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost-benefit analysis ?
my second question concerns the burden of proof .
i remember margot wallström being introduced as commissioner in the committee .
at that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .
in other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now .
. ( sv ) thank you , mrs schörling .
these are two important questions , and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them .
no , one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis .
it is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .
it is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .
mr president , i believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible .
i will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. it is therefore a teratogenic substance .
very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould .
this teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .
so i want to put this question to you .
when human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ?
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .
naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
i cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when i was on a visit to africa .
at a hospice for aids patients , i met two irish catholic nuns who were caring for dying aids patients .
i believe we can learn something from this .
we must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .
as is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis .
consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health .
mr president , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !
commissioner , i would like to come back again to my first question , when i asked about the other commissioners , for it may have sounded as though i was in jest .
indeed you responded in kind , as i knew you would do .
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union .
i have good reason for asking this .
as you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .
that is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , commissioner !
i am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the united states .
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .
ever since we signed this protocol in montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .
this constitutes a good example , therefore .
we should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .
we now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
intergovernmental conference
mr president , i will begin by thanking the portuguese presidency and the commission for all our recent very useful contacts .
let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration .
the intergovernmental conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method based on which europe will be functioning in the twentieth century .
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the intergovernmental conference is to begin its work .
this is because the helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the european union ' s institutional bodies .
i will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .
granted this , the new intergovernmental conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the european union ' s institutions .
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the european public .
in its numerous debates and its reports so far the european parliament has openly supported the convening of the intergovernmental conference .
all the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every member state to the intergovernmental conference .
mr president , the group of the european people ' s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki .
it seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union ' s institutions .
the european council in helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new member states .
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .
we are therefore thinking in terms of the treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a deeper reform of the union .
having said this , mr president , this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference .
in theory , we could have done so .
we could have voted on the 17th of this month and the conference would not have been able to start on the 14th .
mr president , i am very happy to be able to say this to the portuguese presidency because it has earned great respect in this assembly .
mr president , i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the european parliament itself .
however , the european parliament will be reinforced politically by the treaty resulting from this intergovernmental conference .
it is already established within the community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with parliament .
therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with parliament .
however , this parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational european institution if it did not consider the political design of the union .
that it is what we are doing .
we believe that , in the political design of the union , other issues need to be dealt with .
these include , amongst others , the incorporation into the treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the treaty .
of course there is also the charter of fundamental rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which i believe has started very positively .
we are going to work seriously to ensure that the europeans come to see being european as an advantage and that european citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the union ' s institutions .
we will talk about this on another day .
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the group of the european people ' s party , mr president , is ready to give that green light .
mr president , for the socialist group i can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the constitutional affairs committee .
the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .
let us call them the first three subjects of the igc .
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc .
they did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .
they need a political deal .
it is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .
in those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
there are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the union to so many new countries .
nobody is asking for a christmas tree .
nobody is asking for an igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .
however , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
there is time .
remember the igc that led to the single european act .
it lasted only five months .
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty lasted a year .
a year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .
i am pleased to see that the commission shares our view .
the commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .
i thank the commission for doing that even if , of course , i do not agree with everything the commission said .
i think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .
nonetheless the commission has provided a service and i pay tribute to commissioner barnier who is here with us today for doing that .
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this igc .
that is all to the good .
the parliament , the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted .
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 member states yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .
it makes it impossible for those same member states , at the igc , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .
the events in austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the member states .
how , though , is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i.e. before enlargement takes place ?
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference .
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future .
my group , mr president-in-office of the council , noted with satisfaction that the council presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .
you can therefore rest assured that the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left is committed to seeing that the union gets on with the tasks in hand .
the politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all .
that is why we need transparency .
in this way , europe would truly belong to the citizens and the union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .
after all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ?
no , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the union .
the poor turnout at the european elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .
what we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the union .
of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a union of 27 plus member states .
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small states .
this is something i would stress , particularly with my being an mep for one of the major member states .
there is one final issue i would like to raise .
parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the treaty in the area of economic policy .
it is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes .
what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union ' s policies to date .
it is all about creating a socially just europe .
a socially just europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the union ' s policies .
it must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .
our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .
the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept .
quite the opposite , in an enlarged europe , mr president , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding .
the europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .
we are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the european parliament and the commission .
a flexible europe , is a europe which respects its national democracies , which relies on the support of its nations , its national patriotisms , instead of continually persecuting them .
it is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the constraining , convoluted decision making procedures which the commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the italian radicals and i would like to say to the president of the council that he has seen what parliament ' s opinion is .
this is the message that parliament is sending to the council .
i hope that the portuguese presidency - and i add my compliments to those already offered - can convey parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on saint valentine ' s day .
in any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the igc agenda .
this message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
we shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the igc on 14 february , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content .
there is clearly a more ambitious goal .
mr president , the president of the commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the intergovernmental conference .
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .
brussels knows best .
mr prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the european ombudsman .
there is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of member states .
under the banner of " progress towards transparency " , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .
it is , of course , thoroughly orwellian .
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .
in addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. it is therefore ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the portuguese council presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this intergovernmental conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness .
we as a european parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .
the preparations the commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the european parliament ' s motions are anything to go by .
there is more to be said on that score .
it is crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
in the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens .
at the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the european union .
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade .
this is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the european union ' s being able to function come what may .
this is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation .
of course we also want to extend the european parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area .
in addition , we as a european parliament are going to have to take action in relation to economic and monetary union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .
the finance ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the ecofin council and in the euro 11 council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .
unlike mrs kaufmann , i am not in favour of extending supervision over the european central bank as i am an advocate of independence for the european central bank .
however , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
the overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .
we must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference .
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .
there is another point i would just like to draw your attention to .
the european union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .
for this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the treaty .
in my view , that is the most important issue this intergovernmental conference has to concentrate its energies on .
if we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the european union .
this is the crux of the matter .
mr president-in-office of the council , i am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage .
you spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .
i would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exacting delegations .
the aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference .
yesterday , we also discussed the commission , represented by commissioner barnier , who gave its opinion .
this effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , mr president-in-office , you also expressed different views .
we are counting on the portuguese presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the intergovernmental conference .
mr president , only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement .
only a strengthened europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction .
that is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened igc agenda .
the finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this parliament .
portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book .
it is of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join forces for this igc .
in many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .
an essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the treaty .
of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .
what is the commission ' s verdict on this ?
there is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the commission .
not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new member states , but we owe them to ourselves .
if we allow europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .
mr president , there are days when i really cannot understand this parliament. it seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation .
after having restricted , on its own initiative , its participation in the igc to two minor seats , parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this igc .
a good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today .
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .
because of the situation in austria , this is a dark day for europe .
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .
in order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this igc , i believe we owe europe a constitution .
mr president , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .
the forthcoming enlargement of the union is used as an argument for this .
i am convinced that this is an error of judgement .
a federal and centralist eu which intervenes more and more in the government of the member states is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .
a flexible eu which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .
paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level .
it is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .
this text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the european central bank. this is untenable .
if there is a desire to make the eu more democratic , the whole construction of emu must be reconsidered .
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the stability pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective .
article 56 of the treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .
in the majority of eu countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .
it is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .
it also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital .
the resolution requires the european parliament to have increased influence over the intergovernmental conference .
it is , however , important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference is and will remain a conference of the member states .
it is the member states ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the treaty .
it is therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the treaties have been planned were right .
this is what is and was meant by the call for a european constitution .
and it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .
they rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .
however , that is precisely what is happening .
you can think what you like about mr haider , and i personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process .
i welcome commissioner barnier and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon .
on 14 february , we will see the launch of the igc which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .
this is a big task but it can be done .
i think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare europe for enlargement .
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important " amsterdam leftovers " .
in relation to the latter point , ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal member of the commission irrespective of the number of member states joining .
we are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the council of ministers , provided that the larger member states are willing to agree to every member state having a full and equal member of the commission .
i feel i speak for many smaller countries when i make that particular point .
at the igc , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the constitution .
we would accept the division of the treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller member states had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the treaty .
in other words , if we are not represented fully in the commission we will not have an input into policy discussions .
so we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .
we look forward to the charter of fundamental rights and to seeing its contents .
the treaty of amsterdam , mr president , has set the number of european parliament members at 700 and a debate is needed in this parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged europe .
in any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .
i think that , under the present rules of the treaties , the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .
on the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .
we must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .
they must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone .
the issues to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference are exceptionally sensitive .
it may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .
i will mention two point that may create tension .
one is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .
europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
the solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the european union , which is a union of states and peoples .
the other area of conflict is more difficult .
owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future european union must become more effective .
this means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
by its very nature , however , the european union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution .
possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist .
of course they do , but they are not unlimited .
if the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer .
i am , however , optimistic .
mr president , the intergovernmental conference mandate needs to be widened .
the most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the union .
the commission ' s former president , jacques delors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a european confederation .
he has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions , for the sake of clarity .
the commission ' s current president , mr prodi , and the high representative , mr solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
last november , the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for europe : the onion skin model .
in the next resolution on the igc , parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility .
both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the group of the european liberal democrats and reform party .
my colleagues , mrs frassoni and mr onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between union and member states but between member states and their own internally self-governing regions .
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament .
a ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .
scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this house at the moment ; denmark and finland , with the same population , have sixteen .
what will happen to a place like scotland , which i represent here ?
it will become totally invisible !
a growing body of opinion in scotland holds that view .
mr president , to say that the european union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. it has been said many times .
this time , however , it is true .
we have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .
the question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?
that is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the intergovernmental conference , its agenda or its method .
it is clear that the council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .
that puts enlargement in danger .
it jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .
the council must realise that , if we want the future of the european union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next intergovernmental conference must go much further .
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion .
we want an intergovernmental conference , but not this one .
must there be an igc ?
of course there must , but not this type of intergovernmental conference .
the agenda must go much further. we must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the igc and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
being much more democratic means greater participation by the european parliament and allowing the commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .
we must clearly set firm objectives .
the functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point .
have we achieved results ?
we know , i know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .
i would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .
firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .
indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .
we have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .
i do not like the term ' leftovers ' any more than richard corbett does .
they are the first but they are not the only subjects , mr seguro , that the conference must deal with .
however , these council proceedings must be carefully prepared .
throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
i am sure that in this way the european parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the commission will be .
we now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the house , your next opinion , in which you will specify parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .
quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same .
there will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .
the important thing is that we are consistent , and i have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since i accepted the position of commissioner .
our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .
finally , i should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , mr president .
such dialogue between the national parliaments , the european parliament and ourselves is extremely important .
i have said , furthermore , that i would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .
tomorrow , i shall be in london. in a fortnight ' s time , i shall be in berlin .
in three weeks ' time , i shall be in paris , and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and i should like to thank you for taking it .
my second brief comment is to thank the portuguese presidency , particularly mr seixas da costa , for his proactive approach .
indeed , the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the portuguese presidency cannot be just an interim presidency .
it will have to initiate these negotiations .
not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing .
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .
it is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .
after having heard prime minister guterres , the minister of foreign affairs and yourself , i have confidence in the ambition of the portuguese presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few months .
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations .
these are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .
all the more reason for members of the european parliament , ministers , commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .
as far as the commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate .
cross-border services
i would first like to say how indebted i am to the commission for seizing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .
these have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits .
however , the european court of justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the member states were unable to clarify this issue .
the situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services .
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises .
it is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement .
all provisions , i.e. issues relating to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services .
consequently , i do not see that there is any real obstacle to the council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .
i also believe that parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the council to adopt the directives as opposed to the commission ' s proposal .
i am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis .
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .
i believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .
i would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
of course i would add that i continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .
i have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting council decisions .
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .
i withdraw the two other amendments - that is amendment no 18 to the report on self-employed persons and amendment no 21 on employed persons .
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i.e. the correct way to quote .
this would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .
there is also a proposed amendment to both of mrs de palacio ' s reports .
on a final note , i would like to thank all those in the committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .
that is why he deserves special mention !
may i say how the commission welcomes the european parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees , the topic of the debate .
i am extremely grateful for the work that mrs berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .
i would also thank mrs palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .
if the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , member states , the procedure would be more flexible still .
the commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .
however , i do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a member state .
the commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice .
an efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .
it seems over the top to us for other member states to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .
indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a member state to be admitted to other member states too .
that does not prevent these member states from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .
neither does the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three months after the card has expired .
following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service is provided .
that is why the commission supports mrs palacio ' s amendment no 22 in both respects .
as far as the second proposal is concerned , the commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .
i hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , i will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments .
mr president , tomorrow will see a large majority within the ppe group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as well as the amended version .
i propose to confine my comments to two areas .
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .
my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment .
then there are the interests of the member states , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .
neither outcome would be satisfactory .
perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .
therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more member states .
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
consequently , i too have to say that i am in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the commission .
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .
we all know that there are still various parts of the treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as ec .
we are aware that this directive is founded on ec law and not on eu law .
however , before the elections we - the council , the commission , parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu .
they have now got to grips with " eu " .
