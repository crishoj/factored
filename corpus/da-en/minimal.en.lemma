resumption of the session
i declare resume the session of the european parliament adjourn on friday 17 december 1999 , and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoy a pleasant festive period .
although , as you will have see , the dread have millennium bug have fail to materialise , still the people in a number of country suffer a series of natural disaster that truly be dreadful .
you have request a debate on this subject in the course of the next few day , during this part-session .
please rise , then , for this minute have s silence .
( the house rose and observe a minute have s silence )
madam president , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have be a number of bomb explosion and killing in sri lanka .
one of the people assassinate very recently in sri lanka be mr kumar ponnambalam , who have visit the european parliament just a few month ago .
yes , mr evan , i feel a initiative of the type you have just suggest would be entirely appropriate .
if the house agree , i shall do as mr evan have suggest .
madam president , on a point of order .
i would like your advice about rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
my question relate to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .
the cunha report on multiannual guidance programme come before parliament on thursday and contain a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalty should be introduce for country which fail to meet their fleet reduction target annually .
it say that this should be do despite the principle of relative stability .
i believe that the principle of relative stability be a fundamental legal principle of the common fishery policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
i want to know whether one can raise a objection of that kind to what be merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that be something i can competently do on thursday .
that be precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
at the request of a french member , mr zimeray , a petition have already be present , which many people sign , including myself .
this be all in accordance with the principle that we have always upheld .
thank you , mr segni , i shall do so gladly .
indeed , it be quite in keeping with the position this house have always adopt .
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament have consistently show a interest .
it be the case of alexander nikitin .
all of us here be please that the court have acquit him and made it clear that in russia , too , access to environmental information be a constitutional right .
now , however , he be to go before the court once more because the public prosecutor be appealing .
yes , mrs schroedter , i shall be please to look into the fact of this case when i have receive your letter .
but , madam president , my personal request have not be met .
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .
mrs plooij-van gorsel , i can tell you that this matter be on the agenda for the quaestor have meeting on wednesday .
it will , i hope , be examine in a positive light .
madam president , can you tell me why this parliament do not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually pass ?
why have no air quality test be do on this particular building since we be elect ?
why have there be no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?
why have there be no fire drill , either in the brussels parliament building or the strasbourg parliament building ?
why be there no fire instruction ?
why have the staircase not be improve since my accident ?
why be no-smoking area not enforce ? it seem absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
mrs lynne , you be quite right and i shall check whether this have actually not be do .
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestor , and i be certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulation we ourselves vote on .
madam president , mrs díez gonzález and i have table question on certain opinion of the vice-president , mrs de palacio , which appear in a spanish newspaper .
the competent service have not include them in the agenda on the ground that they have be answer in a previous part-session .
i would ask that they reconsider , since this be not the case .
the question answer previously refer to mrs de palacio have s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comment which appear in the abc newspaper on 18 november .
mr berengue fuster , we shall check all this .
i admit that , at present , the matter seem to be somewhat confuse .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything be as it should be .
today be decision not to renew the embargo be extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
so parliament should send a message , since that be the wish of the vast majority .
it be irresponsible of eu member state to refuse to renew the embargo .
as people have said , the situation there be extremely volatile .
there be , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what be happening .
so why should eu arm producer profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question be not presently include among the request for topical and urgent debate on thursday .
agenda
this commitment be important because the commission be a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaty and , therefore , basically dictate this parliament have s political and legislative activity for the next five year .
i would also like to point out , madam president , that this parliament vote to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature .
it do so again during this legislature , in july , and then , in september , it vote once more to approve the whole commission .
there have therefore be enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizen .
to this end , i would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 september , which recommend that the proposal be present as soon as possible .
either the commission be not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
accord to its president , it be in a position to do so .
alternatively , parliament be not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggest .
therefore , madam president , i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( applause from the pse group )
madam president , i really be quite astonish at mr barón crespo have s behaviour and the fact that he be now ask for this item to be put on wednesday be agenda .
mr barón crespo , you be unable to attend the conference of president last thursday .
i be not criticise this ; it happen from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
mr hänsch represent you on this occasion .
in the conference of president , we have a in-depth discussion .
your group be alone in advocate what you be saying now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman have the same number of vote as his group have member .
there be a vote on this matter .
as i recall , the outcome of this vote be 422 vote to 180 with a few abstention .
all of the others be of a different opinion .
that be the decision .
i should now like to comment on the issue itself .
we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone know , the vast majority of our group support the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission .
there be no such document !
the commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in february .
we have said , very well , if the commission do not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as january then we will do it in february .
we have agree to this .
after all , we do not wish to quarrel with the commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path .
however , we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which come out of the commission .
i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our group .
you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content .
the fact that the subject be connect also suggest that we should hold the debate on both programme together .
that be why my group firmly reject the proposal made by the socialist group .
( applause from the ppe-de group )
madam president , i would like to make it very clear that , above all , the commission have absolute respect for the decision of this parliament and , amongst those , the decision establish its agenda .
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .
madam president , i would like to say that the agreement reach in september distinguish this debate from the annual presentation of the commission have s legislative programme .
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialist that the commission statement on its strategic objective should be reinstate .
( parliament reject the request ) president .
still on the subject of wednesday have s sitting , i have another proposal regard the oral question on capital tax .
the ppe-de group be request that this item be take off the agenda .
be there a member who wish to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?
i do not know whether this information be correct , but the ppe-de group would , in any case , be grateful if this item be remove because parliament have address this issue several time already .
decision have also be adopt against a tax of this kind .
that be why my group move that this item be take off the agenda .
thank you , mr poetter .
we shall now hear mr wurtz speak against this request .
madam president , i would firstly like to point out mr poetter have s lack of logic .
it be not a lot to ask .
we shall proceed to vote on the ppe-de group have s request that the oral question regard the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( parliament reject the request , with 164 vote for , 166 vote against and 7 abstention )
madam president , i would like to thank mr poetter for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
madam president , have my vote be count ? i be unable to vote electronically , since i do not have a card .
my vote be " in favour " .
indeed , if we add the two member who have declare themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
madam president , the presidency have already declare the result of the vote .
there be no room for amendment .
that do not happen .
i would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , i might be allow to give a explanation of vote on behalf of my group .
this be a important matter. it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just do in the light of their own political analysis .
madam president , i do not wish to reopen the debate , but i have also ask for the floor , to comment on mr barón crespo be motion .
you do not call me either .
i regret this , but the vote have already be take and the decision be made so let us leave the matter there .
i be terribly sorry , mr hänsch and mr cox .
i do not see you ask to speak .
even so , i think the position be quite clear and they shall be enter in the minute .
when we adopt the minute for today have s sitting tomorrow , then any member who think the position have not be explain clearly enough may ask for amendment .
this seem to me to be a workable solution .
of course , the minute for tomorrow have s sitting will take into account any additional explanation .
i think this be a better solution than proceed now to extremely time-consuming explanation of vote .
mr cox , mr hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
madam president , if the vote record correctly how my group vote i shall not , and cannot , object to that .
if your ruling be that i cannot give a explanation of vote , i accept that but with reservation .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minute , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the position adopt , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( the order of business be adopt thus amend )
safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good
all of this be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and be therefore to be greatly welcome .
our amendment from the first reading have , i believe , be take into account very satisfactorily .
the one unanimously adopt amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport , which concern the timetable for implement the directive , be something which i would urge you to support .
i would urge you to endorse this .
the renovation project , which last for month , cut off this important route between the north and south of europe .
the traffic which have to be divert because of this stretch the patience of many thousand of people in the eu to the limit .
in fact , all hell broke loose in some municipality in my province .
prevention have to be our answer to disaster of this kind and this draft directive be a important step towards well-trained safety adviser being available , so that the right action be take in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enact european law to ensure great safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rule be transpose by the member state in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they be also apply afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
madam president , first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which have , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report look at the issue of harmonise the examination requirement for safety advisor working in the area of transportation of dangerous good by road , rail and inland waterway .
i congratulate him on his excellent report .
my group will therefore support the common position and look forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible .
when it come to safety my group will always support any initiative to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent event have prove .
madam president , i would like to make a few comment .
i would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the commission for the proposal it have submit .
we be concern here with the harmonisation of examination requirement but also , in fact , with minimum requirement .
this be a pity , in a sense .
this be important , but so be enforcement and there be , of course , a number of reason why we need to pay particular attention to this .
or ship from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ship over here , with all the obvious risk that this entail .
furthermore , it have transpire that research in the port in belgium , finland , but also in japan have show that 50 % of container with partially dangerous cargo be not deliver correctly for shipment .
in short , the issue be a important one .
if we look at the situation where safety adviser be concern , in a number of country it be compulsory to employ such safety adviser in company as from 1 january of this year .
there will be major problem with enforce this rule at present , especially with small company , as these cannot afford safety advisor .
these small company either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which cause problem .
it be therefore also being request that iso 9002 certificate possibly include the fine detail of these activity in the form of annual report and company analyse .
the work be done. all that remains be the business of enforcement .
i would like to mention one final point .
this give them a competitive edge for the interim period .
madam president , the importance of transport safety be highlight on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so .
the ever increasing volume of good passing through europe entail all kind of risk , know and unknown , for employee and the social environment .
those have to deal with these risk should therefore meet stringent requirement .
this , however , do not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment table by the rapporteur be perfectly logical and i can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his report which , though technical , be nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
i should like to make just a few comment .
considering that it be only today that we be deal with a commission proposal first made on 19 march 1998 , even though parliament respond relatively quickly , this time lag be a little too long .
this be not just the fault of the commission , but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
my second point have already be mention : it concern the minimum standard .
in principle , i believe that in many case where transport be concern we should be working towards increase flexibility and country-specific rule .
however , when it come to safety , i be rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , be in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .
i can live with these minimum standard , but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rule in some country then we should work towards great harmonisation .
my third point have also be mention already .
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue play a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the condition of competition worse for some country unilaterally and improve them for country such as austria or other transit country .
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous good to a minimum , in all country , whether they be transit country or not .
very briefly , i would like to thank the various member for their intervention and to tell you that safety be one of the commission have s priority in the field of transport .
as mr simpson have said very correctly , this be a process which we can never take for grant or regard as have come to a end .
the process of increasing safety margin and safety guarantee in transport be a process which must be improve day by day .
in one of the worst accident to have occur recently , the good being transport be not dangerous in themselves .
margarine and a few kilo of paint which , in principle , do not present risk , led to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirement guarantee the maximum degree of safety can be further improve .
finally , i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all type of transport .
but i would like to say that safety be a priority objective for the commission .
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speaker and especially to the rapporteur , mr koch .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
transport of dangerous good by road
delay in the cen have s work be now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , annex cannot be adapt to take account of technical and industrial development .
i regret this since we be have to take action because others have not do their job .
in this respect , i accept this proposal to amend directive 94 / 55 / ec which have be table for discussion today .
the amendment to the directive on today be agenda do not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous good in the community .
the amendment to the directive be consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the member state obtain more power .
the commission decide whether the member state may impose certain rule of their own .
in so doing , it be support by a committee of expert on the transport of dangerous good under the regulatory procedure .
the procedure for the exercise of these implement power confer on the commission be laid down afresh in the council decision of june 1999 .
two of the amendment table and adopt unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amend comitology procedure .
in addition , the need for great transparency have be point out .
a further amendment allow the member state to impose more stringent requirement , in particular for vacuum tank , if work be do or good be transport as a priority in temperature well below -20ºc .
this be in the special interest of northern european region .
i do realise that this be only a small step towards increase transport safety , but i would ask you to endorse this report .
mr president , colleague , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
i be speak for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this be quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that do last longer than two minute .
i would like to briefly comment on the commission have s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road .
the commission have s proposal , however , do not take account of all the fact , such as the cold climate that prevail in the northern region .
consequently , i have table some amendment to mr koch have s intrinsically excellent report , which have be adopt by our committee .
my amendment concern the frost-resistance rating for tanker carry these dangerous good .
accord to the commission have s proposal -20ºc would have be sufficient .
on the shore of the mediterranean , it be hard to imagine that in lapland temperature can fall considerably lower than that .
there be support for the eu in lapland also , so let us remember them .
i have thus propose that the frost rating be lower to -40ºc .
this would be necessary to keep safety standard at the level they be in northern region previously .
i hope my proposal will be take into consideration in tomorrow have s vote .
mr president , with your permission i should like to begin by express my admiration for the way in which you execute the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
i thought that it be quite superb .
this directive be a contribution to this .
what we be doing today be essentially a nuisance .
mr president , the report we be discuss here do not , in itself , entail any major change .
most of the propose amendment be of a purely technical nature .
very large quantity of dangerous good be transport around the eu , both on road and railway and by sea .
this make it necessary to have proper rule governing transport of this kind .
in area after area , we be now obtain common minimum regulation for the member state .
this be extraordinarily positive , and there be cause to thank the rapporteur , mr koch , for the work he have put in on this issue .
this be also important where the prerequisite for the internal market be concern .
i should like to conclude by comment on a third matter which be also of significance , namely a amendment table by member of parliament , mr ari vatanen .
in many way , the prerequisite differ from one member state to another .
by approve this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern part of the european union .
this make it necessary to also take account of the way in which material and packaging be affect by cold of this kind .
it be good that , in establish the present regulation , we can also be flexible .
i hope that the commission be able to accept the present amendment .
the reason mr koch produce his sound report be because the work in the cen and within the unite nation economic commission be proceed none too expeditiously .
for one thing be clear : even if we come to a excellent arrangement within the european union , traffic do not stop at our border , it go beyond them .
hence there be certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provision .
if the commissioner be unable to do so today then would she be prepare to inform the committee in writing of how matter stand and what stage negotiation between the cen and the economic commission be at ?
mr president , i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplement the debate which we held in october on rail transport .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiate element which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours .
a moment ago , mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperature , not of 20 degree below zero , but of 40 degree below zero .
lastly , mr president , the basic problem justify this amendment of the directive have be point out .
the commission accept all of the contribution of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , mr koch , which be contain in the various amendment , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendment which have be propose .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
structural fund - cohesion fund coordination
a major part of wale , as you know , have be grant objective 1 status under the structural fund programme .
it be quite clear that many people within wale be look to the european structural fund programme to alleviate some of the great difficulty that we undoubtedly face .
we have see poverty growing in wale ; and growing still further since 1997 .
we have see the gap between rich and poor widen .
we be look , therefore , within the structural fund programme not just to see industrial restructure but also to see a wide improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality .
what be , however , deeply damage for us be the belief that in some way the grant of structural fund assistance be something that have be , in a sense , a success of the government .
it be sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulty that wale face .
that be why i want to highlight some of the issue that i believe the commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the commission to deal with point in relation to additionality .
we be dissatisfied with the fact that those figure seem to have be in some way hide within uk figure .
we look to the commission also to ensure that there be match fund for project .
we look to it to challenge the uk government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural fund expenditure , be involve in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the commission ensure that structural fund mony be spent in a way which be transparent .
too much of what take place within this parliament be not transparent .
this be one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wale .
mr president , our committee view these issue very differently and , to start , i will speak from the point of view of research .
this will be possible with action on the part of government , and such decentralisation of high education will be a unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
poverty and wealth use to depend more on mean of livelihood .
i would like to draw people be attention to amendment no 1 and 2 which be agree by the committee on employment and social affair but not accept by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .
these amendment deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local scheme to develop employment opportunity and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this parliament have view the social economy as a important potential provider of employment .
these amendment also fit in with this parliament be view that social exclusion be a serious issue need constructive action .
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendment have very powerful reason to offer to both parliament and their citizen who be seek employment .
in her report , mrs flautre also draw attention to a area where coordination be sorely lack , yet desperately need .
the commission proposal refer to the four pillar of employment strategy and the five field of action of the european social fund .
but the lack of specific guideline here be particularly to be regret , as the idea of link social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this be a oversight which be now being dealt with constructively .
mr president , commissioner , the proposal present by the commission , in accordance with its mandate , be a reasonable start point for the committee on agriculture and rural development .
this , as well as the deficiency in the network of infrastructure and service and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore be seasonal and lack diversity , exacerbate the exodus from rural area .
the consequence do not inspire hope .
it be the young people who be disappear , who be get a education and finding work outside of the rural area , all of which have a unfavourable effect on those area .
this lack of infrastructure be also a obstacle to the establishment of company and the creation of job .
we have to remember that rural area represent almost four fifth of the territory of the european union .
agriculture only provide 5.5 % of employment in the union .
furthermore , three quarter of our farm worker be part-time and require supplement to their income .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to begin by thank mrs schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
i think that this work have be carry out extremely well .
small and medium-sized business , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these fund .
mr president , it be incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , mr evan , of why wale actually achieve objective 1 status .
it be because of the discredit policy of his own conservative party .
i can tell you that the british government be aware of its regulatory requirement on objective 1 additionality .
i suggest mr evan go back and read the regulation .
my group have made extensive amendment to both report up for debate today .
i want to focus our mind on the essential role of the guideline .
it be important to identify the skill and potential of our region in the hi-tech sector .
it be particularly important in the light of report in the media that europe be rapidly lose ground to the us in the hi-tech growth industry of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programme be also very instructive in telling us what guideline should not be about .
they should not be about create additional layer of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shift priority and policy halfway through project development , result in inevitable delay and underspend , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guideline cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the commission or in the civil service .
there must be a internal coherence in the commission directorate , while respect the specific local and regional aspect of commission programme .
the conclusion be that we must make the case for guideline to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme manager and fund-user and to get the maximum potential out of our new field of regeneration .
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak region we will eventually get them back onto the road of attract substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mrs schroedter for a excellent report .
she have go into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she take account of many of the amendment that have be table regard this report .
the rapporteur have also quite rightly state that parliament be not heard in time regard the guideline .
we be badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stand parliament have take will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programme and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report grow too large when it be being debate .
it contain detail and issue that have already be raise in previous report .
at this stage it be more important to concentrate on assess how we can use this process to steer union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim be to reduce regional inequality .
our group emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of member state and the role of local player in draft and implement programme .
it be especially important to get sme involve in the planning and implementation of programme .
our group also consider it important to take great account of remote and peripheral area and wish to increase interaction between town and rural area .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member state exercise and we be calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that have take root in the draft and implementation of programme .
project implement with support from the union have have their effect water down all too often by slow decision making and complicate administrative process .
fund have often be grant for project which have have no lasting benefit for the area concern .
project have to be carry out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
while the report be being prepare , it be interesting to discuss the union have s regional policy in general .
for us new member , it be the first time , and this be a very interesting process .
this report be very good and our group support it .
mr president , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the structural and cohesion fund and of their coordination be to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we be oblige to participate in draft directive and also in assess their result .
we be oblige to do so because we be the representative of the citizen in a europe of citizen and not just in a europe of state and of region .
we feel that the fund be a necessary but insufficient condition for achieve economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistaken in use the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
some speaker have already mention unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicator , which will enable us to see the current state of regional society that be in a worse situation than others , and how they be evolve .
this fact mean that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically .
i agree that the european parliament do not have the opportunity - or that it be not give the opportunity , as we have reach the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directive .
i do not think , however , that this report have come too late .
our citizen cannot accept that the european union take decision in a way that be , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that official accept their responsibility and that there be communication with the citizen .
this be what we be today ask the commissioner for .
this mean that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authority and national government with regard to how these fund be to be spent .
member state be urge to attach great importance to integrate strategy for revitalise relation between town and rural area .
this latter point be of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our city be very important we must always strike a balance in our policy between promote rural development and improve the live of city dweller .
we do not want to build a europe of city alone .
the structural fund have play a key role in the development both of urban and rural part of peripheral country , mainly through the upgrade of road , water treatment and relate transport network .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spend guideline laid down by the eu leader at their berlin summit last year , which be support by parliament at its last may plenary part-session .
key eu programme between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly help to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral country and objective 1 region within europe .
the key now be to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
mr president , on numerous occasion in the past i have disagree with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issue .
this time , however , i actually agree with her. whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , i cannot say .
nevertheless , i would like to commend her on her work .
unfortunately , this do not happen .
mr bernié be not to blame for this as it be a matter for the previous committee .
i be raise the issue just to reiterate parliament have s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guideline provide they do not deviate from the comment we have made so far .
personally , i at least be totally in favour of the guideline .
as a islander , however , i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this be not the first time that this issue have not be give the consideration it deserve .
this have be a ongoing concern for the five year that i have be a member of this parliament , and i have raise the issue time and time again .
commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the treaty of amsterdam provide for a integrate policy for island .
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time have come to implement the programme , and so member state should also assume their responsibility and do their job properly .
as for us in parliament , i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which be sign in may .
i be absolutely certain that this code will be observe and that parliament will keep abreast of all the development and detail concerning the implementation of the programme .
mr president , commissioner , in this minute and a half i should like , first of all , to congratulate mrs schroedter .
consequently , i feel we must look to the future and establish guideline for the mid-term review in 2003 , and thus have a influence on the second phase of programme set to follow 2003 .
the first be the harmonisation of national development policy and regional development policy .
subsidy be not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public service be lack .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that union policy interface with the subsidiary national policy for regional development ?
the second challenge be that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical term .
these be two area of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us .
finally , in this time of natural disaster , i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural fund .
as you know , it be up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
europe should not be completely absent , as the state tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response , even though we be going to be fund a large proportion of the national operation .
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
i also think we should ensure , or ask member state to ensure , that there be some publicity give to european aid whenever it be use to repair damage cause by natural disaster or accident .
mr president , the priority give to financial and monetary criterion reinforce the increase in inequality of every shape and form .
as far as french planning expert be concern , for example , the most probable scenario today be that of the entrenchment of regional disparity within each country .
well , the structural fund have help to apply a brake to this process .
our project of a europe that aim to satisfy social need envisage the convergence of living condition towards the high common denominator .
its implementation would certainly require extend the scope of redistribution instrument such as the structural fund .
what we be propose specifically be a unify capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the fund use to support the harmonisation of social protection system and the reduction of working hour at european level .
the commission , however , though bound to issue guideline , do so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re-establish its place in the political sphere .
it be one of the step towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this be what persuade us to vote in favour of it .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
to this end , europe as a whole , and each member state individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resource and capacity , including the structural fund .
for example , in recent year italy have have problem in utilise the structural fund , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operator at local level .
there be , therefore , two point to which i would like to draw the commission have s attention .
firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a mean of ensure proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operator in decision-making , precisely so that imbalance and inequality can be avoid .
the report itself be well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issue , lack clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .
i would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we be concern with the proper use of the structural and cohesion fund .
next , we all too often see vast sum of money being spent on project whose outcome will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there be no effective way of terminate the project if it have not prove successful .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the fund be disburse .
there should be great involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the fund equation .
i urge the house to support these change .
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which be a meticulous and substantive piece of work .
despite the step take thus far , these level be still very high , and be unacceptably high as regard unemployment .
these policy objective can only be achieve through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guideline .
let us not forget that when these policy be effective , they also benefit european citizen by directly improve their quality of life .
mr president , mrs schroedter have s report undoubtedly contain several important observation , and i would like to congratulate her on that .
however , i feel that we should be a little more concern about the actual direction and outcome of the community have s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy do not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravate it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural region have be irreparably damage by the existing regional policy , which have have dramatic consequence on employment level in rural area and on the living condition of farmer , particularly in the south .
regional disparity be becoming much more mark within the member state .
if we examine the data present in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade have witness a proliferation of regional disparity .
the union have s economic and social policy be just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
a large section of the union have s population have strongly condemn this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-root .
unfortunately , the new guideline seem to be heading in the same direction and there be no sign that thing will change once they have be implement .
the first be the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we be concern to hear news that the commission be taking this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion be one of the union have s fundamental objective .
secondly , i agree with what have already be said on the issue of the island and i would also like to bring the outermost region to your attention .
in future , we would like to see great ambition apply to the subject of the outermost region such as , in my country , the island of the azores and madeira .
i would like to ask if the commission be able to enlighten us on the reason for the delay in the commission have s report on the outermost region , which have be long await by parliament ?
mr president , first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestion we made .
mr president , commissioner , the guideline be intend to help steer the member state towards achieve the reform objective contain in the programme .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the commission have s proposal in this respect be reminiscent to a far great extent of a catalogue of possible measure within the scope of the various policy area .
nonetheless , their true purpose be to give direction and to set priority .
i be particularly in favour of a propose amendment table by my group to paragraph 10 , to ensure a appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the project .
i should be very grateful , mrs schroedter , if you would actually include this propose amendment in the part relate to subsidiarity in your positive deliberation .
they be growing , but only in term of gdp .
they be increasing in competitiveness but they be not all experience a increase in wealth because there be no increase in employment and there be still difference in employment opportunity between region .
commissioner , please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affair and treat it as a matter of priority , because this be our citizen have great problem .
please take account , in strategic term , in the revision and in the allocation of reserve , of employment need , because this , fundamentally be what the structural fund and the cohesion fund require .
cohesion policy need to be strengthen further because a europe which totally disregard the standard of living in its region can neither be reliable or viable .
this mean putt forward the commission have s priority , base on past experience in implement the programme , as well as current community policy relate to structural operation .
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i be refer both to the national and regional level .
and so , mr seppänen , i shall also mention at this point , speak of the national level , the link with the cohesion fund .
this be the purpose of these guideline .
concerning the most remote region , it be only quite belatedly that we receive the memorandum from the various government , but this be not necessarily a excuse , just a explanation .
we must therefore take these memorandum into consideration and produce a extremely thorough piece of work .
so that be the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economy .
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comment you have made , lady and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
it be true that consultation with parliament have only come about at a late date .
due to the election to the european parliament taking place around this time , however , parliament be not able to undertake its examination of these guideline until after the text have be definitively adopt , in july 1999 .
now to the form .
on the subject of the role of the guideline , mrs schroedter , you point out that this be the context in which guideline on a number of european objective , often very precise one , should be provide .
i shall not list them all , but they include implement intersectoral policy , increasing efficiency in the use of public fund , assist the various partner in drawing up regional or national programme together , etc .
the commission take note of these , but several of these guideline or these question be relate more to other document , such as the guide to the reform of the structural fund or the methodological working document .
drawing to a close , i should like to focus on a number of challenge which you reiterate , mrs schroedter .
i be thinking , for example , of the idea that these guideline be not specific enough in their recommendation .
this claim that your report make must be see in the context of last spring have s negotiation .
i actually quote the text itself , in quotation mark .
moreover , the guideline may not substitute for the programme or the ex ante assessment which must be the tool use to specify priority and the effectiveness of these programme .
you then mention , mrs schroedter , the section of the guideline relate to urban and rural development , point out that urban development be not sufficiently take into consideration .
i find the opposite the case .
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attach , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , i have occasion recently to say as much to all the minister responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .
it must , however , be stress that the guideline under discussion be relate only to the structural fund , whose objective 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .
i shall remind you that the commission be going to be approve the objective 2 zon plan for france , sweden , austria and luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have a appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the region affect by the storm .
indeed , this be my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french department which have be severely disable by the storm .
i be very please with the level of support offer by your house to the commission in establish these guideline , which have be submit to the member state for information when establish their own programme .
this can only reinforce the concept base on a number of element of good practice draw from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programme .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
social and economic situation and development of the region of the union
the european commission have s sixth report present very valuable conclusion .
i shall summarise two of those highlight by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the negative conclusion be that the great effort made have be more efficient in harmonise the european region have gdp and productivity than in harmonise its level of unemployment .
it be therefore necessary to link structural finance more closely to job creation .
this , commissioner , be the first commandment for the coming period .
mr president , commissioner , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for have take due account of the propose amendment while the committee be debate it .
the sixth periodical report give a basis for assess the implementation of the union have s regional policy aim .
the report show that growth have be uneven , despite all our effort .
very rapid growth be continue in central europe .
the strong regional centre also continue to grow fast than the general european average , whereas many southern european and northern area be develop considerably more slowly .
we now require a in-depth analysis of why regional policy be not produce the desire result in all area .
be the reason bureaucracy or be it because insufficient notice have be take of interregional difference , long distance , climate that be too cold or too hot , sparse population and austere condition ?
how can the union respond to the challenge of global development in a way that the less develop area can remain a part of that development ?
it be also important to discover what the effect of union enlargement will be on structural fund and the development of the union have s more remote area .
the member state must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some member state have be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional fund when regional aid coming via the union have be increase .
this have chip away at the result that regional policy have produce .
in the future , we must also develop indicator so that measure can be target at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration have not be give sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight have to be give to the decisive importance of sme as employer and force behind regional development .
it be absolutely essential that company in area develop more slowly adopt the late technology and know-how .
our group be in favour of adopt this report .
mr president , commissioner , the european union have s regional policy have , until now , not be able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing difference in our inhabitant have income .
mr president , commissioner , mr berend have s report be precisely in line with the strategy determine by the european commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness be brought right to the fore .
the overarch objective of the structural fund such as job creation , boost equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , be only mention in passing .
this attitude appear to me to be unjustified. i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be place on these point in the seventh periodic report .
they be support by appropriate european union structural fund activity .
support only the competitiveness of company will never be able to compensate for the envisage cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there be no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these objective 1 region .
concentrate to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientate economic policy be not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .
it be imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientate economic policy if we be to have any chance at all of improve the social situation in these area .
the situation vary to a enormous degree throughout the region .
in other word , what be need be a number of accompany measure if anything at all be to be accomplish there .
mr president , my compliment to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
the key goal of the structural fund be to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the region within the european union .
by stimulating a diversity of investment , the european union be endeavour to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment .
from the sixth periodic report on the region , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentive do not always have the desire effect .
as indicate by the rapporteur , the effect of the structural measure , on the other hand , be minimal as far as employment be concern .
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid be therefore call for .
also , the observation that the disparity between region within member state sometimes even become more pronounce raise serious question .
mr president , it therefore seem worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authority , especially in connection with boost employment .
it be , after all , they who have most knowledge about the region which fall under their remit .
by allow them to develop tailor-made plan for the relevant region and , if necessary , tie this in with financial aid , a high return can be achieve .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
i be therefore in favour of the commission delegate the practical detail and implementation of measure to the member state and region .
following on from this , it be probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to region , to give member state more say anyway .
by shift the criterion from the region to the member state , we can avoid a great deal of problem later on .
finally , i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european country .
the report show that , in general , they be a long way behind eu country , especially in term of gdp per capita .
with the plan accession of a large number of these country in the foreseeable future , it be a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposal for reform sooner rather than later .
mr president , commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it be possible to fulfil the state objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparity between the region have increase rather than decrease , there have be a certain amount of convergence between the member state themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment level in the worst affect region barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some case .
i wonder why it be that the structural fund be not employ more efficiently .
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion fund and the structural fund have fail to have the desire effect in all region and country .
genuine structural reform and a competition-friendly taxation policy be the cornerstone of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursue a cost-intensive structural policy that do nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measure draw up so far must be analyse .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union have be a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of job and when there be a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
this issue , which have a impact on their everyday life , be a key issue as regard eu credibility .
it have to be concede that the eu have already aid , i would say quite magnificently , the development of poor country .
i remember what portugal and greece use to be like when i drove through those country for the first time twenty-five year ago .
in this connection , french speaker would speak of a " coup de chapeau " : in other word , i take my hat off to the eu .
the eu really deserve such a gesture , but difference between rich and poor area within country be still too great .
what be the result ?
people react by vote with their foot and go where they can earn a crust .
consequently , we have to build school , hospital , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many time over .
this be very costly and it also cause very great social problem .
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they be born and raise , if they be give the chance to , in other word , if there be work there .
we must give them this opportunity .
this be a moral obligation the eu and all of us have .
the solution , as i see it , lie in clearly encourage entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business , but create will .
i mean the attitude where a person want to get on in life , whether he or she be a employee , the owner of a business or a official .
what be a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easy for his or her child .
in this way , positive development of the region be also possible , because people will start business and will work if they be give the chance .
mr president , commissioner , as my time be limit , i shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruit of growth be not distribute equitably within the union .
the most remote region , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rate , offer one example of this .
in reunion , for example , the rate be 37 % .
this be not a situation relate to the economic climate , however ; rather it be a structural problem , create by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment be envisage in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such case .
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
the commission document expect to be ready in december 1999 be delay until january , then february , and the initial thinking do not fill me with much optimism .
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission .
as regard taxation , state aid , the structural fund and defend our traditional product , practical measure characterise by daring and ambition must be plan as a matter of urgency .
mr president , as all the previous speaker have do , i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .
i should also like to make a few comment , firstly , mr berend , regard the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .
you point out the quality of the report and you even write , if i be not mistaken , that it mark a real improvement in comparison with previous report .
on behalf of all the official of the commission and my predecessor , mrs wulf-mathy , i must inform you that we be very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself .
i be thinking of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resource potential , small and medium-sized business and direct investment from abroad .
so much for the quality .
i do not wish to spend time right now , mr berend , going into detail regard my opinion of the general point which your house have already endorse .
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stress , the role of local and regional authority , the private sector , both side of industry , association and local community action group .
regard this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensure that the term of the structural fund regulation be apply properly .
mr fruteau state just now that the fruit of growth be distribute inequitably .
mr fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there be growth , and that we be not working in a period of stagnation or recession , as have be the case in the past .
you will tell me that situation of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
i agree with your analysis .
fourthly , a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stress just now , the promotion of a equal opportunity policy for woman and young people .
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium-sized business .
mr vatanen express this most forcefully just now .
i should like to mention a few specific point .
mr berend , you express a wish that zon should be implement quickly .
well , we be coming to a end of the zon phase .
tomorrow , the commission be to decide on the matter for four more country and very soon , i hope , it will be italy have s turn .
you may therefore be satisfy on this point , since zon will have be complete for all the country affect by objective 2 .
mr berend , you also mention , as do mr aparicio sánchez , the lack of reform in the fishery sector .
this type of sectoral analysis pertain rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fishery , under commissioner fischler .
nonetheless , i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include a analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concern .
several of you mention point which must be include in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mention some of these .
this will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the commission , in the next few years. and finally , there be the cross-border aspect .
i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendation on all these point .
finally , i should like to mention a few political conclusion which you be , in any case , familiar with , but whose main element i should like to reiterate .
this be my first point regard the policy .
my second point regard the policy be as follow : the structural fund have made , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .
i shall say that something be already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instrument available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first country who be going to join us .
i be thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument , which i shall be responsible for implement in the next few week .
you see , lady and gentlemen , we have only just initiate the new programme and we be already considering together the impact of the union have s enlargement on our structural policy .
this sixth periodic report which you assess as positive on the whole , mr berend , be a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting be close at 8.25 p.m. )
adoption of the minute of the previous sitting
the minute of yesterday have s sitting have be distribute .
be there any comment ?
mr president , i respond to a invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter refer to in the minute .
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagree and vote against the proposal of the president of the socialist group .
there be one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .
when there be major set-piece debate schedule between this house and the european commission in the future , we should clear all of our line on what be our mutual expectation at least one full working month in advance .
there need firstly to be clarity between all of the group of this house and then between this house and the commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution create a unnecessary fracture in institutional relationship .
look at some of the press report of last friday , i believe that the commission and its president exercise commendable self-restraint in the way they comment publicly .
that be something for which i have a deep appreciation .
it should not be dramatise into something more than that .
thank you very much , mr cox .
i understand what you be saying .
we have take note of this .
mr president , concerning item 11 of the minute on the order of business , we agree yesterday to have the bourlange report on today be agenda .
however , it be withdrawn from the committee on budget last night without being discuss or vote on .
it therefore need to be withdrawn from today be agenda .
mr wynn , that make sense .
the report be hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
this need to be look into because it be clearly a indication that something be seriously wrong .
i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this be a serious problem .
mrs ahern , we have take note of this .
i would ask you to bring this specific case , which have to do with the ventilator on a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestor , who be , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our service , however .
thank you very much .
( the minute be approve )
reform of european competition policy
the next item be the joint debate on the following report :
mr president , commissioner , today we be engage in a important debate about the european union have s competition policy .
however , we be also discuss the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relate to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper .
it be all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .
on reading both commission document , one learn that 1998 be the year in which the modernisation proposal introduce in 1997 be pursue and even partially complete , which be something our own ongoing parliamentary work have taught us .
it should continue along this path .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 be not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there be nothing that could not be further improve upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , commissioner , but there be one point that i would just like to go into now. transparency and accountability belong together .
i do not wish to call the distribution of competence between the commission and parliament into question .
here too we should continue along the path we have choose , strengthen and intensify it .
there be one thing i would like to make quite clear though .
parliament be a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matter of competition law , of all thing , be truly scandalous .
therefore , i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
i expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful case , even give the treaty status quo .
i also expect the commission to be pro-active in support us in our call for codecision in legislative procedure .
this will be a good test as to whether there be reasonable cooperation between the two institution .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition be not , however , a end in itself .
competition be a instrument and do not always produce ideal solution .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenet of economic theory be that the market be failing in many respect and anyone who take issue with this be nothing more than a ideologue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resource and fact .
but optimum efficiency do not necessarily come about of its own accord .
framework condition be indispensable when it come to prevent abuse , monopoly law being one example .
but on the whole , this only serve to prevent abuse ; framework condition alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goal in isolation .
competition yes , restriction in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid form the lion have s share of the competition report 1998 i would still like , regardless of mr jonckheer have s report , to say one more thing about it .
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provide for such purpose , provide it do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this be precisely the area where it be even more important than it be in monopoly and merger law for decision to be comprehensible .
my last comment be intend not so much for the commission as for the member of the group of the european people have s party .
the commission report be essentially a descriptive report detail the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sector , accord to various typology , such as the method of finance and the objective pursue .
this being the case , there be considerable disparity between state , which may be measure in various way , such as , for example , as a percentage of add value and per wage earner .
i think it be also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be assimilate in some way into state aid .
this clearly show that it be the four country which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other thing , which come at the top of the list .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposal made in the report .
the commission can only collate and analyse the data provide by the member state .
it be therefore down to the state and region to ensure the quality of the data provide , and our committee consider that additional effort must be made in this respect .
it be in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , have champion the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the internet .
seven amendment have be retable for this plenary sitting .
there be in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , i see as particularly important .
i should like to conclude this presentation , commissioner , by stress two thing : firstly , a concern of the member of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involve the pre-accession process for the country of central and eastern europe , in term of competition policy and state aid .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regard the future responsibility of the european parliament in the matter we be discuss , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the intergovernmental conference .
as you know , commissioner , our report argue that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
mr president , commissioner , my contribution to today have s debate concern the steel aid code , that be the state aid in europe grant in accordance with this code and which be assess by the commission .
there be a total of 27 case in 1998 and the commission submit its own report on these .
the ecsc treaty be due to expire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today be the question as to how state aid be to be manage in future .
the competitiveness of the european steel industry also form the subject of the commission have s most recent communication , which we have not yet debate in parliament .
as in other sector , the general ban on state aid accord to article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty also apply to the iron and steel industry .
accord to this article , state aid be irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .
exemption be only permit in precisely define case .
under article 88 , the commission be oblige to supervise state aid .
in 1998 , the large case concern the supply of company capital total eur 540 million to the preussag in germany .
furthermore , the member state must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intention concerning state aid .
the rule pertaining to the steel industry be draw up on 18 december 1996 .
in addition , there be a special provision of up to eur 50 million for greece .
however , there be obviously problem with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few year that be not brought fully to bear in the report .
as far as parliament be concern , it be important for us to waste no time in get down to a debate on the regulation that be to succeed this state aid code once it have expire .
there must be no watering-down of the existing principle underlying the steel aid code .
no one want a unimpeded subsidy competition in europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry have undergo consolidation in the past few year .
consequently , parliament believe it be necessary for the steel aid code to be amend in the light of the industry have s claim about unequal treatment , and for the commission to provide the council with follow-up regulation .
we all know that so far the council have drag its foot with regard to follow-up regulation of this kind .
the reason for this be that people be under the impression that once the steel aid code expire , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the european commission have s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the treaty expire , steel aid must be regulate by a council regulation accord to article 94 , for that be the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this be the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not cover by the code .
a council regulation that be directly applicable law must also be observe by the regional government .
what we need to avoid doing in the future be compromising competition condition and disturbing the balance in the market .
mr president , lady and gentlemen , the internal market be not complete .
subsidy , monopoly and barrier to competition be still impede market and development alike .
national government provide subsidy and promise that this be the last time , but then it happen again .
subsidy distort allocation , both within and between country .
a successive phase out of state aid be require , and more and more market must be open up to competition .
this apply to those which have be turn into monopoly , both private and public .
public monopoly be , more often than not , phase out reluctantly .
increase competition and newly establish organisation should be able to provide significant benefit in term of welfare , including within the sphere of education , health care and social service .
public monopoly must be replace by competitive structure .
europe must be modernise , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapt in such a way that it become a more competitive environment for consumer and company .
effective competition push price down and raise standard of living .
it be precisely upon price level that consumer policy have fail to focus sufficiently .
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market be the basis for our work .
its legislation be to apply equally to all , to large and small country alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulation be need if barrier to competition be to be dismantle .
the eu have s own regulation too may therefore need to be analyse .
the new model now being test by the commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the establish competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well anchor in the member state have national authority .
in six month have time , it may be appropriate to carry out a analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation have s effect upon the commission have s role .
the question of how best to make further progress have so far be solve through the idea of holding a inter-institutional congress which will open up a unbiased debate adopt a broad perspective and involve representative of different interest .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principle or to return to the more radical change which have be discuss .
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solution and to analyse amendment from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly apply in matter of competition .
wrongly apply competition policy may cause loss in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which be a important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
a conference where the issue be properly debate will make it possible to straighten out misunderstanding , at the same time as perhaps improve upon certain point .
parliament and the commission can together increase their effort to achieve a effective competition policy and so create new opportunity and new resource for our citizen .
in fact , in my own constituency of stockholm , we have many good local example of increase supply and improve quality which have arise precisely because of exposure to competition in area which be previously total monopoly .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which have be strengthen in the course of consideration of the report by mr von wogau and mr rapkay .
we hope that the legal point of view will also be accord the importance which be only reasonable in a state base on the rule of law .
mr president , as a new member i be please to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there have be a delay .
i would like to begin by thank the rapporteur mr von wogau , mr langen , mr rapkay and mr jonckheer , as well as the commission , for their excellent cooperation .
all this be to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrive at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
the commission have put forward a new white paper on this contain two key point : drop the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
drop the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration cost , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus being place on the individual in the business world , of course .
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
the second point relate to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
we be not discuss the fact that although every eu law be only ever decide on centrally , it be precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop a instrument for this in the anticipate legislative procedure that will enable enterprise to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the commission in this matter .
the way to a european monopoly commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
however , when it come to what the future hold for competition , there be two issue dear to my heart .
one be subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition be vital to the economy and require there to be efficiency , and i believe we should also permit competition in the region .
competition between the region will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union .
i would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation scheme , saving bank and regional bank , and gütesiegel .
here , a region have , by its own effort , create a mean of marketing its own product .
this own initiative must not be destroy by european intervention .
i believe there be also a need to raise the de minimi regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the region into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relate to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although i be not going to talk about market failure just now .
i have already refer to the regional and saving bank sector , but i would just like to focus on a matter one hear again and again in certain quarter .
these day , someone who live in a old people have s home be accommodate within the social field .
however , i could also regard them as a customer , and i believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the way in which the social field , that be evolve structure , stifle competition .
apart from that , i could refer to any customer , any sector , as customer , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social field .
thank you very much , mr radwan .
i would like to congratulate you on what be refer to in german parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech .
mr president , commissioner , i be speak on behalf of my fellow member , robert goebbel , who be unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the committee on economic and monetary affair , the jonckheer report have give rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
a slim right-wing majority succeed in remove any reference to market failure .
even if the majority in this house be to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationship in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminate all public intervention in the market do not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resource .
while , since the dawn of time , the market have be the key forum for human interchange , it have never be perfect .
the market favour the short term and immediate profit .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand be generally to the detriment of the weak party , consumer and worker .
in order to function , the market need rule .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we european socialist be in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market be not a end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the european union or individual state must not take over from economic operator , but public authority must define the rule and objective which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructure , offer train , save job and thus know-how .
the main objective of the union have s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be align with the objective of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinder the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the internet be not a product of the market , but the result of research finance by the american army .
the world wide web , which have enable the meteoric development of the information society , be develop by cern in geneva , once again with public aid .
the german government have s intervention to save the holzmann group be criticise as a unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
president duisenberg even attempt to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .
i do not hear mr duisenberg criticise the intervention of the american monetary authority to save the hedge fund , ltcm .
wish to save 60 000 job be , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital do not seem to present any problem for the advocate of the free market .
public mony be use in order to repair the damage cause by international speculation , as be the case in mexico , asia and brazil .
human labour , on the other hand , be consider to be a simple factor in the equation .
we socialist reject the liberal have naïve optimism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in europe .
the state hand must still be clearly see to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge .
mr president , commissioner , i want to begin by thank mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have a especially important role .
it be your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. these may well have grand vision when it come to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seem boundless .
let me mention the late example we have see : holzmann , a company which receive considerable aid from the german government ; sawmill in former east germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyard .
these be three area in which many danish company be experience major problem and be being squeeze out of their market .
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party have table 80 amendment in the committee , all concerning state aid .
these be amendment which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which be very important with a view to making the internal market work .
i should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague on the committee for support the amendment table by the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .
another issue be that of what we be to do when state aid be declare unlawful .
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid be paid back ?
at present , there be no common rule in this area , and we vigorously urge the commission to make a point of harmonise the rule on repayment .
this be the way forward if we be to ensure uniform condition of competition .
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mention by a number of my fellow mep , and also a scoreboard showing where the member state at present stand with regard to state aid .
you have show us the way , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard .
it be this which inspire us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
i very much hope that you , commissioner monti , will support these amendment , and i look forward to your comment and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
to conclude , i want to welcome the commission have s xviiith report on competition policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work have be do .
but , as i have already mention , our overriding objective ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
mr president , commissioner , there be just two question which must be answer .
be state aid to business or inter-company agreement legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exception to the absolute rule of the market economy ?
it be also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreement and voluntary restraint agreement , since all these agreement make it possible to reduce the detrimental effect of competition on social or ecological requirement .
so our clear response be that , yes , such aid and such agreement be legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreement must be expressly justify .
the von wogau report propose refer supervision of the legitimacy of individual case to national level .
we feel this be relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything .
we demand that the great possible transparency should be in place and that great power of investigation be grant to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exception after the fact .
mr president , once again we be debate the european union have s competition policy .
but let us stop to consider the circumstance in which this debate be taking place and the conclusion to which it should bring us .
the overriding feature of today have s economy be massive merger and acquisition involve huge company with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational group .
should we not be discuss this issue ?
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce control on the activity of these private-sector monopoly .
certain sector of european industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have be hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffer tremendously .
they have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundred of thousand of worker have be made redundant .
when will we debate that ?
the scandalous concentration of power in sector of strategic importance be give speculative multinational group economy the size of entire state , and member state of the union at that .
and yet , we keep on weaken the public sector and we be ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualify public procurement contract place with public-sector corporation as state aid .
at the same time , unemployment be spiral as a result of the loss of hundred of thousand of job .
worker be facing a massive attack on their employment and social right .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and be totally oppose to it .
mr president , commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the commission have deploy every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
the competition policy have , as far as these resource permit , contribute to this event .
have said that , governing mean planning. it also mean being responsible and , in this new context which have be force upon us , competition law naturally have a essential role to play .
finally , on the subject of modernise the implementation of article 85 and 86 of the treaty , we do not think that decentralise application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
the commission be , in fact , retain not only the power to take matter out of the jurisdiction of national authority , but clearly obliging the national jurisdiction to avoid dispute the decision of the commission at all .
national state would thus become the secular arm of the commission regard observance of the application of rule which they do not control .
state interference in the economy be , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrance place in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for european user and consumer .
what be being do may well be very important , but it be still not sufficient .
mr president , we be holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government have s right and left hand , so to speak .
whilst the emu criterion be force member state to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry have so far remain in place .
this be understandable , because it be highly likely that member state which start to cut back on state aid will cause company to leave , with adverse effect on employment .
but , at the same time , this be not understandable because bad management and non-viable job should not be fund by taxpayer have money .
in principle , only horizontal regulation be permissible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition .
the rapporteur have s amendment no 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
amendment no 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself do not result in the ideal society .
vulnerable people find themselves hard hit .
market force must be employ in a sophisticate manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizen and company .
if this come to nothing , then the government have to step in .
the commission have s white paper on modernise competition policy seem more like a discussion paper .
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
do the pressure of work within the commission really decrease when national judge be require to report to the commission ?
what be the council have s opinion on this and be the commissioner prepare to completely reconsider these point ?
mr president , a white paper , by definition , be not something you can take or leave. it be there to generate reaction and the white paper have certainly succeed in doing that .
it form a sound basis for discussion and be to be welcome in this sense .
i understand where the author be coming from and i share their view .
i also assume that you , commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessor and that your office will pursue the same objective .
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiative in order to de-europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but i have my concern and question nevertheless .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy have s application .
in general , i be a great defender of cultural diversity but not in term of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market need a uniform competition policy , not only in term of concept , but also in term of application .
it be true , there be some european regulation and interpretative statement on the way .
the commission be also said to have the right of evocation and can give guideline to the national competition authority .
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we be able to take two step forward .
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regard legal certainty .
many dossier be currently being file with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission have look into the effect its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
fourthly , i would like to be inform of why the commission do not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringement of the competition rule .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate county will be able to play our game .
they be still in train , as it be .
what guarantee do we have that they will grow into first-class player in the league of the internal market ?
sixthly and lastly , i would remind you of a point that i have already raise in my report on vertical restriction , namely the legal privilege of company lawyer .
if the commission implement the white paper objective , it seem to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal adviser will become more pronounce and hence even less acceptable .
be the commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyer in all member state legal privilege ?
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regard the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .
the fact that the group of the party of european socialist be very much in agreement with your report be clearly demonstrate by the fact that only one amendment have be present during this procedure .
we be , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outline of the white paper .
since the treaty enter into force , community law on competition have be one of the tenet of community policy .
after almost forty year of being in force , these rule be beginning to show sign of exhaustion .
for this reason , modernisation be essential .
that modernisation come to be particularly necessary for five reasons. firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralise application ; thirdly , procedural rule ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
the system of individual approval need urgent reform , as be unanimously request by specialise company , academic and lawyer .
i have not attend a single forum of specialist in competition law which have not request a change to the system .
a system , such as the current one , which be capable of making so few decision , be they approval or prohibition , be something less than a valid system .
national competition authority be able to apply article 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
however , they could not apply article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevent the coherent application of article 81 ( 1 ) .
a reform of this point be therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition be basically contain in regulation 1762 .
the voice in favour of its amendment be unanimous .
the court of justice accept some time ago that community competition law could be apply by the legal body of the member state and in 1994 , the commission publish a communication on this subject .
it be therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticism of community competition law be its excessive red tape .
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreement be anti-competitive or not depend more on a analysis of their clause than on their effect on the market .
it be therefore necessary to introduce a economic analysis .
the white paper intend to resolve these problem and we therefore support these proposal .
it be also true that we note certain deficiency which have come to light in the report .
amongst these , firstly , be the fact that , despite trying to modernise article 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carry exclusive weight .
at the moment , with inter-company agreement and the privatisation of monopoly preserve dominant position and even consolidate them , the combate of abusive conduct be becoming particularly important .
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repeal and replace with a new regulation .
for these reason , we be going to vote in favour of the report .
frankly , i believe that this modernisation have be satisfactory .
if it function well , if we be satisfy , if the commission have basically act correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various argument have be present in its favour .
because , if this be not the case , we will be face with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce element of unfair competition into the function of the european internal market .
in that event we would not have move forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .
mr president , i would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represent by the xxviiith report on competition policy in the union , when compare to previous report .
i would also like to highlight the work carry out by the rapporteur , mr rapkay , who have dissect this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .
i would also like to fully support his comment on the need to allow the region - such as the basque country , which i represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
i therefore believe that something be missing and i suggest that we establish more regulation , lay down clear rule , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investor , worker and the citizen in general .
this be why i give this report my full support .
i would emphasise that this be going to be extremely important for our future , for europe have s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general .
mr president , for british conservative the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy be at the core of achieve a effective single market across the whole of the european union .
it therefore follow that any proposal which suggest major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examine .
the truth be that the single market be not yet complete .
during my six month as a member of this parliament , i have become acutely aware of the determination of many member to drive forward what be describe as the european project .
we daily hear the need to promote a wide and deep europe .
but all this , in effect , be so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacle which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .
that be the context in which i want to consider the commission be proposal .
i should like to make it clear that we have the great confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .
we look to him as the man to root out cartel .
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposal and subject them to rigorous examination .
that be something that have be do by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affair , mr von wogau .
he mention early that the report be carry with a significant majority but not with my support .
so although i may not share his conclusion , i believe he have illustrate in his report many of the issue which the commission must address .
the first be the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
i know that the commission be set against this , but the potential exist .
i remain worry about the capacity of national court and the capacity of the national competition authority .
i remain worry about the whole operation of the judicial process .
i ask commissioner monti the other day what happen if he prove to be wrong and there be a effective renationalisation .
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .
well , we in britain be look to the european court at the moment .
we find that the european court be not able to provide us with interim measure in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .
unless anybody think that this be merely a nationalistic point , in the factortame case , in which the british government be the defendant , it take ten year for the european court to give a ruling .
so , judicially , something need to be do .
i ask the commission what can be do to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .
it be important that business have legal certainty .
i mention this again to commissioner monti recently .
he said we must not always be carry along by lawyer .
i must declare a interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the unite kingdom .
we all have , as it be , our history to live with , but it be important that business have legal certainty .
i would also ask the commission whether a analysis have be undertake of the implication of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that be now becoming so much more european policy .
i know there have be a analysis of the implication for the commission of the change .
we have be told how , currently , people be time be being waste and that the change , therefore , could be beneficial .
but i really feel that , in the circumstance , we want to know what the implication would be for business .
finally , we , as british conservative , be look for a change in direction , towards the development of a independent competition authority .
i would like to hear what commissioner monti have to say about that .
mr president , the european union have s competition policy have be of central importance since european integration begin .
it be therefore with some justification that competition policy be one of the most important policy .
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it be this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopoly and merger supervision .
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operator , against whom nation-state be no longer able to impose limit .
that be why we should bear in mind what be said by the french writer vivienne foresty , who describe the state of the world in term of the economy have s reign of terror .
society be surrender itself to the economy .
that be precisely what we do not want in the european union .
european competition policy , as we very often forget , be not just important for fair competition as such , but also for price , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
in common with the other member , i call for parliament to have codecision right where competition law be concern .
it be essential that this long overdue step be take .
it be also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti want to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament , as he do in the dialogue with non-governmental organisation , consumer protection association and the public .
great transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decision relate to competition policy .
it be particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rule in view of eu enlargement .
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offset the deficiency of the market and further community objective .
a word on the white paper : the revision of article 81 and 82 represent a change of direction in monopoly policy .
the system currently in force create transparency , afford enterprise legal certainty and have , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and act as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .
the problem of overwork highlight by the commission be not a sufficient reason for making radical change to the legal system .
indeed , it be debatable whether this could be carry through at all without amend the treaty .
mr president , i be very glad that mrs randzio-plath mention the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker have do so .
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleash enormous competitive force within european business which be being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportion .
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis have be put on the implementation of article 82 , especially when we be witness abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
as a member for the basque country , i would like to express my total support for the implementation measure for fair competition in the market .
mr president , commissioner , competition be exactly what we need .
in other word , we must succeed in link the competition criterion that be necessary to the economy with those relate to managerial economics .
i say that as a entrepreneur who have a vest interest in this .
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspect go hand in hand .
i will give you a example : the european union be right to support the grönitz steelworks in brandenburg , although out of 5 000 job only 700 remain .
but these be competitive job , for this steelworks be now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .
it go without saying that that be not what the european union have s competition policy be design to achieve .
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirement of the national economy and the pre-requisite of managerial economics .
indeed that be the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed region that will protect people have s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientate economic policy as oppose to one focus heavily on supply .
mr president , ever since i be elect to this parliament in 1994 i have never witness a report which have such anti-irish sentiment and overtone as the jonckheer report which we be debate today .
i would like to quote verbatim from the report : " state aid per capita be high in italy , germany and ireland .
ireland clearly be in the lead when national and community regional and social fund be put together . "
i believe that the rapporteur be simply play with figure .
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social fund into this mathematical equation .
i should like to remind the member that the european union have agree to the new regional aid guideline for the period 2000 plus .
this be merely a extension of the policy objective to complete the internal market within europe .
regional disparity must be overcome if the internal market be to succeed and prosper .
i welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for sme for fix investment will be permit for company setting up in objective 1 region in europe post-2000 .
i remind mr jonckheer that irish company or foreign company in ireland still have to cross two sea mass to reach the mainland european marketplace .
no other member state be at such a disadvantage .
mr president , the monopoly have ban be the key element of function competition order in europe .
the commission deem the practical administration relate to the monitor of the monopoly have ban to be unsatisfactory , something i would wholeheartedly agree with .
but opinion differ as to the solution .
the commission have s proposal do not formally deviate from the monopoly ban but the upshot of this proposal be a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
in other word , we be making the transition from the principle of ban to that of misuse .
both i and other mep utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which be something i consider to be unacceptable .
the commission be give up its monopoly on exemption .
competition restriction be to be automatically exempt against the background of this plan system of legal exemption , insofar as the provision of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .
the requirement to lodge application in brussels will be drop ; in other word , the commission will be completely in the dark in future .
this be unacceptable to my mind .
the commission have s programme be to be supplement by enhance follow-up supervision of the national authority and member state have court .
but if this take place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here be a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
this be unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of european policy .
the change of system in european monopoly law that the european commission be contemplate be high risk as far as competition policy be concern .
there be enough other option in the present system to safeguard open market and free competition .
in any case , the commission have s proposal refer back to old proposal that be put forward as long ago as the fifty and sixties .
there be no majority for this at the time .
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it be damage by concession in agricultural policy .
forty year on , this proposal have again be place on the table and i be certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopoly , to the detriment of europe have s consumer .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
mr president , in this important debate on competition , i be speak this morning with particular reference to mr langen have s document on the steel aid code .
as the court of justice recognise in 1996 , the steel industry be particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbance .
indeed , several year ago , this be the conclusion of a report that i compile on the strength and weakness of the european steel sector .
it be therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and case of company closure .
in the same category of idea , it be essential that member state fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid grant to their steel company .
the commission suggest short deadlines. i agree with this request .
like the rapporteur , while i be please with the commission report , nonetheless i deplore the fact that it do not cover all aspect of the aid .
in the interest of equality , either the code must be apply or it must be modify .
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission have s proposal on this matter .
mr president , i be also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concern aid to the steel industry .
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues. firstly , i agree on the need to guarantee equal condition for aid to all member state and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
order in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decrease drastically , result in a loss of job .
i live in a region where the ship-building industry now have very serious problem : asturias .
with global market , we need global employment law and global subsidy .
competition policy must continue to be accord central importance and will not be renationalise because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy .
however , it must be " europeanise " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility be to fall to the individual , without the commission give up any of its responsibility .
i be in suspense as to how the discussion , which be broadly base , will be incorporate in the first legislative proposal .
the commission report confirm that , with the exception of germany , state aid to business be increasing .
the commission find this worrying only from the point of view of the condition of competition .
as far as we be concern , we look at thing from the point of view of the interest of the working class .
society gain nothing from these massive transfer of public fund to private business .
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidy and state aid of various sort have increase by 24 % during the reference period .
with what aim ?
not to save job .
all these firm have go ahead with job cut and even redundancy .
not to improve working condition , for in increasing production with few worker , working condition be made worse .
do these firm need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturer have be making colossal profit for year .
it be because the rich people be being favour everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection be being reduce , public service be being abandon , hospital be being close .
mr president , today have s debate be extremely important because the principle of competition have probably be the cornerstone of the internal market .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation have implement article 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provision which may affect competition .
firstly , fiscal provision of a indirect nature and recently , thanks to commissioner monti , there have be direct provision , the code of good conduct in particular .
this have work fairly well , but , as in the famous film casablanca have time go by have and we must adapt the legislation we have be apply until now to the new circumstance .
in this respect i have observe a significant consensus in all the intervention .
firstly , it be necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rule .
it be probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there be confuse rule , regulatory vacuum and rule that only lay down undefined legal concept .
this be all the worse - as be the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implement the legislation lie with national authority .
fourthly , and lastly - and this have already be mention - the international legal order have change .
we have see this in the abort seattle conference and we be now seeing it in the bilateral conference with different region or country of the world .
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
mr president , commissioner monti , there be much that be good in mr jonckheer have s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sector .
first of all the report reveal parliament have s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market function flawlessly .
many of the report have s conclusion , however , be cause for concern , at least for our group .
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculate on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveal the need for survey such as this .
aid that be base on the self-seeking ambition of a nation give company unfair advantage , thus distort competition and leading to a ineffective , uneconomic division of europe have s meagre resource .
the form the aid take be important .
form of state aid that require a effort from the beneficiary be to be support .
the report on competition policy further stress the commission have s confidence in hard and fast rule instead of putt the emphasis on economic argument regard efficiency , which affect competitiveness .
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desire if we do not show we trust in the market .
if competition policy be to be made subordinate to the aim of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
competition policy have to be see as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assess with reference to trade policy and non-material right : we should not just be emphasise its social dimension .
the aim of social policy can be best realise through strong economic growth , not by making compromise with regard to decision on competition policy .
mr rapkay have s report also emphasise the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regard certain basic principle of competition law .
aim instead at harmonise minimum standard will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the low hurdle and end up with the low common denominator , which will water down all the aim of competition policy .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for his commitment and i welcome his thought .
there be a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which be not found in the english market and be only present to a extremely limit extent in italy .
another issue concern the economy of country involve in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assist economy for ever more if provision be not made for gradual adjustment .
safeguard the social function of the market be what make the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improve people have s quality of life .
a point to consider regard the new rule concern the economy of the outermost region and island , all of which must be protect .
we ought therefore to consider create two focal point of a external market by instigate profitable relation with russia and the mediterranean country , precisely so that their economy become less peripheral .
mr president , competition be at the heart of the european internal market policy and be also its driving force .
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , mark by clear , uniform rule .
in his report , karl von wogau manage to capture this very well .
but europe be changing .
the economy be growing , we be enlarge to 25-30 member state .
the european commission will become overburden if it pursue its current policy .
it be therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this be not in question .
have said this , i still have concern about the propose decentralisation .
how will the commission , as keeper of the treaty , guarantee that decision be take uniformly in matter of competition in london , palermo , helsinki and , soon , budapest and ankara ?
this be necessary if legal inequality be to be prevent , and issue of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgement be give .
it be not enough to say that , in the member state , there be already 40 year have worth of experience .
in the netherlands , the competition authority be still in its infancy .
this country have a very small market which , unfortunately , be often at the same time define as the relevant market .
this in contrast to germany , where a very experience kartellamt be exercise its power within a gigantic market .
uniformity need to be work on .
think of specialist , national court with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .
this special court in luxembourg be necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interest involve , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounce two year after the event , as be now quite normal .
what be the commissioner have s opinion of this ?
i would like to finish off by making a important point for small and medium-sized business .
through cooperation , small , independent firm must be able to stand up to the large chain .
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small business .
but we all want to be oarsman on it. we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish a interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finish touch to this essential reform .
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be address .
secondly , we have the issue of company have legal certainty .
it be true , commissioner , that the commission be not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr kara said .
there have only be nine rejection .
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
how often have a lawyer with two company and one project , in the face of a commission guideline give ex ante , change that project in order for it to comply with the competition rule !
this be therefore a aspect to be consider .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improve upon .
here improvement should be made .
only in certain country , germany for example , be there specialise jurisdiction .
perhaps this be a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bear this out .
we have heard some very thorough observation which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and be important for the institutional order .
our common aim be to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .
i , personally , would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examine the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report .
i would like to divide the consideration raise during this debate on the von wogau report into four group .
i will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : i be convince that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear be justify .
the commission proposal accord the commission a central role in establish guideline on competition policy .
the reform do not entail any reduction in the commission have s activity , but require them to focus on the most important dossier .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition culture being transplant and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plant thrive , and they be certainly not all the same .
the fifteen set of national provision will gradually be abandon , permit great use of community law , which a high number of protagonist will be able to apply .
allow me to emphasise that this be communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rule must be bear in mind , but i do not believe that it should be exaggerate .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rule .
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provision and through its decision-making practice .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanism in place to prevent dispute , and the white paper set out mechanism for information and consultation .
in this respect , i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis-jørgensen and mr huhne of monitor implementation .
this then be the idea of monitor implementation .
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authority and so on , it be evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law be apply by national authority and court .
that be why the commission want to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
this go at least some way towards alleviate your concern , mrs peij .
concerning mr evan have point regard the implication for business , it be important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conduct .
the purpose of publishing the white paper be , after all , to collect comment from business as well as from other source .
we have receive many excellent observation and contribution which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there be one point about the impact for firm which be of great importance .
this be raise by mrs thyssen , mrs peij and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of sme .
many speaker have underline this .
the commission be paying particular attention to legal certainty for sme .
we be propose a system which considerably improve legal certainty for sme .
why ?
be this simply a political gesture ?
no .
in the system we propose reform our substantive rule in such a way that most sme will be cover by block exemption regulation , as in the field of vertical restraint .
most sme have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
we have a de minimi notice which contain a declaration that since sme be not involve in market dominance they be not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 ( 1 ) .
the fourth group be legal certainty .
( fr ) mrs thyssen also refer to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyer .
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounce a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i. this ruling remains valid and there be nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof .
the white paper require only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examine : the exchange of confidential information .
the guarantee which company must be give be currently under discussion .
we share the same basic view but the rapkay report lay emphasis on several point that we shall need to consider very carefully .
i will mention only two , in order to be brief .
the first be great transparency .
mr jonckheer , i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union .
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly do not mean i do not consider it important .
mr jonckheer , mrs thyssen and mr gemelli raise the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate country in term of competition in general and of state aid .
i can only say very briefly , that we be actively working with them on a practical level : they be making preparation , they now all have competition law and be setting up the relevant authority .
in connection with the issue of state aid , i would also like to take up one of the point raise by mrs riis-jørgensen , among others regard repayment of illegal aid .
in april 1999 , the commission adopt new rule of procedure which introduce specific rule on repayment .
in the near future - and i can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rule .
finally , mr president , i would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report , which , although gear more towards a specific sector , be a valuable contribution .
when we have finalise our proposal on the new rule and decide on the most suitable legal form , i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
i be especially grateful for all of this .
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue open with the committee for economic and monetary affair , and , at a more general level , with parliament .
in this regard , i like your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
competition be not a end in itself , as mr rapkay rightly point out , but it play a extremely important role in european integration .
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the european integration process , as it have do in the past .
thank you , commissioner monti .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
protection under criminal law of the union be financial interest
particular attention in this respect should be give to combate fraud , to detect it , punish those guilty of it and prevent it from happening .
create uclaf by mean of the task force and setting up the anti-fraud office olaf be important step , as be the regulation on protect the financial interest of the community and on local monitor .
the union can only impose sanction in the field pertaining to administrative law when case be expose .
so far , effort on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtain money to be return only have limit success .
it be for the member state to undertake criminal measure .
then there be difference between the national legal requirement of the individual member state , together with protracted or even unfulfill request for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
what be more , the agreement on the protection of financial interest and the two subsequent protocol sign by the european council in 1995 do nothing to change this .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratify by all 15 member state .
after five year only four have do so .
this state of deadlock , which threaten to undermine the credibility of the union , have inspire parliament to initiate the setting-up of a european public prosecutor have s office .
we be give new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposal that will enable this goal to be realise .
we would like to make two recommendation arise from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the right of individual .
i support the propose deadline for the commission being 30 september in a propose amendment .
the second recommendation relate to criminal proceedings .
the existing monitor committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .
there be no question of this influence the administration of justice in the member state .
the court of justice be to monitor the legality of the legislative act .
further support for this proposal be also to be found in the second report of the so-called five wise man .
the commission , mr barny , mr vitorino and several member state be equally receptive to the idea .
i call upon you , lady and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopt with a large majority .
we can set another example here , to the effect that parliament be taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .
mr president , i be happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .
if we have to give a prize for the article which be most difficult to understand , least clear and most confuse - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
at the same time , it be a especially delicate issue because it deal with the protection of the community have s financial interest , as mrs theato have explain very well .
we be all aware - and this parliament have be the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interest of the community. but be careful .
the conclusion of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , be a critical report .
it be a report that have be propose by the committee on budgetary control and it be a own-initiative report .
one of the reason why we be very keen to bring this forward be because , whether we like it or not , the european union have a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .
it be sometimes exaggerate but there it be .
we need to do something about it .
a lot of them have not sign up to or not ratify the convention on the protection of financial interest , and therefore it be clear that something more radical need to be do .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .
the question be : who prosecute ?
that be where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility be it when you be deal with a body that cross so many frontier ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concern of member state .
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service be a very sensitive one .
we be all aware that a all-out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority take precedence over the national judicial authority be a step too far for some people .
but the discussion need to begin and we be therefore calling on the igc to start discussion .
of most importance to parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the european union , be how to deal with people who work within the european union institution .
at a time when we be look at the whole reform process it be critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecute , and that be not the case at the moment .
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this have be outline by mrs palacio .
i should like to make clear that my group be going to propose a amendment delete the detail of how the commission should tackle this question .
we be aware that it be a delicate debate .
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all party .
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor .
but there be a definite commitment to change the status quo which be totally unacceptable .
mr president , i would like to start by congratulate mrs theato on her report .
i think it be a first-class report which will , for the most part , be support by my group .
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have prefer to take it a little further at this stage .
judge from the discussion held over the past five or six month , this could well be the case .
we all know that , in 1995 , it be agree that the union have s financial interest should be give better protection under criminal law .
but the member state fail to cooperate .
this be just a political fact about which little can be do at present , i think .
unlike the previous speaker , who have now disappear , my group be strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .
my colleague jan-kee wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he have already publish a report on the same subject matter .
i think what we need be , at european level , to come up with exact definition of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .
i myself have be involve in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
this , i thought , be no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
i would like to make one general point on politics .
whatever we may say about the european election , the low turnout be a fact .
we can improve on this by punish crime in europe quickly , and this must be do at european level .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
mrs theato have s report may help to restore confidence in european institution .
i believe that be something we be all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the result of the last european election and of the level of turnout .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the court of auditor publish its report , which criticise the member state on account of various incidence of fraud .
so far , however , the european institution have not have sufficient mean at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually take place and that matter be remedy .
it be precisely this process that undermine confidence every year .
we will need the european public prosecutor have s office for this , which will see to it that there be clear legal guarantee , also for suspect .
have said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be vote for your report as a unite front .
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgiving to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermine subsidiarity .
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato have s report receive more support .
indeed , we be talk about criminal law , the area where resistance that national state put up to communitisation be , and will be , fierce .
indeed , it be unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulation solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interest - without first have create a european legal system .
reading the precise and comprehensive explanation in the theato report make you realise just how many problem still need to be resolve and what these problem be .
therefore , on behalf of my group , i would like to say that we support the theato report ; i nevertheless think that this be essentially a subject that should be include on the igc agenda .
mr president , mrs theato have s report on the protection of the european union have s financial interest propose centralise criminal proceedings by initially create a european public prosecutor .
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aim in the long term to confine the national state to a subordinate role in these matter .
moreover , this proposal be liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reform .
accord to the theato report , the european public prosecutor be need , in particular , in order to better support the inquiry of the anti-fraud office , olaf .
at the same time , however , we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervise by a european union court .
in this way , a small european reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we be in danger of upset if we put forward this type of reform , which appear to be quite specific .
the union for a europe of nation group , on the other hand , wish to see a polycentric europe with nation link in a network .
it be fine , in principle. it need only be fine-tune .
mr president , mrs theato be propose institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
mrs theato probably forget to include a european prison now that we have the fbi , the european police , in the form of olaf .
all this would be establish by two regulation , one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code .
and indeed there be a twofold shift .
firstly , the classic eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single vat , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
next we have the puritan shift : the teutonic europe of the north , the europe of the lutheran , calvinist and quaker , wish to inflict its moral order on us .
basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
mr president , it be essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interest of the european union , more so these day than there use to be .
the fraud and corruption scandal of the past have have a profoundly damage effect on the confidence of europe have s citizen .
the credibility of the effort we make here in parliament to employ our finance properly stand and fall with the effort we make to deal with such scandal and prevent them from arise in the future .
this do not just mean administrative change but also structural change ; in other word we must create instrument which be actually capable of afford protection under criminal law .
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discuss this .
there be no doubt that i myself be one of the advocate of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competence at european level .
when it come to the demand made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it be the call for there to be clear delimitation of competence that should take centre stage .
taking these aspect into account , i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as propose , and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf .
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involve eu fund ?
i do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way use the existing tool .
a alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as propose at the last summit .
in the way it be structure , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigation into crime .
it be just such practical cooperation there be a need for .
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it be quite unacceptable that most member state should still not have ratify this agreement .
it be simply too bad , and i can well understand why people be becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor have s office instead .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such a office .
it be , after all , only the most serious crime which would have consequence under criminal law .
ninety per cent of case would be disciplinary matter concerning negligence or incompetence .
instead , there be a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulation and disciplinary procedure and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulation concerning dismissal on the ground of gross negligence be never use .
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putt our own house in order before we plunge into construct grand new institution !
mr president , we all want to do something about combate european fraud .
but the question be now : be the european union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this be that we know very little about this .
the tampere summit be about combate crime .
everyone be supposedly please about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
there be no european anti-fraud legislation in force because the member state , as be state before , have not ratify the treaty text submit .
so a great deal have to be do in this area .
and what exactly should be do ?
two thing , and mrs theato have s report clearly spell these out .
firstly , the same penalty clause regard european fraud must apply in all member state of the european union .
so , unification in this small area .
the european public prosecutor have s office be nothing to be afraid of. i feel there be a lot of scaremonger going on .
it be , in fact , something very positive .
just like europol. europol , involve police cooperation , do not rank above the national police force , but be there for the purpose of exchange information between police force .
this be exactly the task which a small , limit , european public prosecutor have s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
parliament support this .
the committee of wise man support this .
i urge the council of minister and the european commission to do the same .
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .
corpus juris be something that be set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territory would have a major impact on the traditional system both in ireland and the uk .
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor be something which member state have a right to be inform about .
indeed when the plan be initially draw up they said it would be restrict to case of fraud against the eu budget .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the member state and the citizen in the member state to be properly inform .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk need to be address .
there need to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there have be to date .
it be unacceptable that something like this have be foist on the member state of the eu without any proper public debate .
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intend to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair , mrs theato , will not be without its critic .
another major criticism of the text concern secondary law .
article 280 of the treaty allow the council to pinpoint the appropriate instrument to curb fraud .
nevertheless , we be left feeling slightly perplex that they envisage a institution which will mean high quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussion of this .
that be to say , they be neglect the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such a important legal system .
we want to express our perplexity as regard these point by abstain in committee .
we find ourselves deal with some very serious event , which in the past seem to be the norm .
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community have s interest , its image and its relationship with taxpayer , who be a indispensable and essential part of community life .
for this reason , it be right to look at the issue of safeguard common interest , and to establish better link with legal system within the individual state .
in this respect , we be face with the most sensitive issue : what role would a european public prosecutor play in relation with the individual national community and their domestic legal system ?
this issue need to be explore further in both cultural and practical term .
today , we run the risk of add a new institution to the already numerous and vary institution which exist within each country .
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular point .
sometimes it be worthy of satire and merit discussion , but i digress .
the point i want to make relate to mrs theato have s report .
i be refer to recommendation 1 and 2 .
after all , there be no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reason it have now become a independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .
we obviously have difficulty there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulty with regard to offence .
nothing have change there .
as far as that be concern , i believe there be judicial uncertainty that need to be overcome .
mr president , for year , parliament have call for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union have s financial interest .
on the other hand , more pro-active attempt , such as olaf , which be currently operating , have not allay legitimate concern about the system of guarantee for individual right .
nevertheless , it raise some very basic question .
surely these subject will be of the great relevance to a revision of the treaty which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
mr president , the eu be now expose to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the european union have be seriously damage .
to remedy this , vigorous effort be require .
we therefore welcome increase resource for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicion more efficiently .
at the same time , we think it be obvious that those who commit crime against the eu must be able to be held accountable in a effective way .
it be unfortunate that the convention for protect the union have s financial interest have be put into effect in so few member state .
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of table proposal entail the further development of the already existing legal framework .
on the other hand , i be not convince that making the process more efficient in this way require common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
in the present situation , i be therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor , which it be scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutor from the individual nation cooperate .
the major problem be not that no measure be being take against crime commit against the union but , rather , that these be commit so often and far too seldom discover .
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves be , however , to find the right mix .
the mismanagement and example of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in a old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through a exaggerate supervision of detail , prevent the development of a modern administration .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten have s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration take responsibility for its own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tell us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualify evaluation be often as effective as detail bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge be , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .
this require staff train , more modern recruitment method and , above all , openness and public control .
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively be the best protection against irregularity .
the commission have give its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reform document this .
parliament be commit to this task , which be something this report bear impressive witness to .
the commission wholeheartedly agree with the rapporteur that this be a unacceptable situation
olaf , the european anti-fraud office be one of the most important instrument the commission have for fulfill its obligation to combat fraud .
this be why the commission resolve on raise a complaint against these two bank at its last meeting , and i hope that parliament approve this step .
the second recommendation in this report relate to assess the legitimacy of the investigative measure undertake by olaf in the various european institution .
i be fully in agreement with the monitor committee and the rapporteur on this point .
in other word , there be a loophole here which must be fill and i will examine the solution advocate in the report in the interest of moving thing on .
there be one thing i would ask though : i believe we must prevent the debate on extend the legal basis for olaf from leading to the misconception that olaf do not now have enough authority .
no , there must be no undermine of olaf have s authority , and neither do i think this be the rapporteur have s intention .
as such , i would ask you to give olaf have s work your full support , also in its present form .
thank you , commissioner schrey .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.

heaton-harri ( ppe-de ) .
mr president , on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rule of procedure : namely rule 133 ( 2 ) and 138 ( 4 ) .
these be both about vote .
that be quite right , mr heaton-harris. i put the matter to a vote by a show of hand because none of the group have request vote by roll call .
you know that vote by roll call or electronic check only take place if member of the house request it .
in this particular case , i can assure you there be a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just vote on .
mr president , i be not refer to that particular vote but to vote in general .
it be obvious that some president do not look at the hand , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic vote system .
i be wonder whether this be the correct procedure .
i know it take longer , but should we not always have a show of hand first ?
i shall , i assure you , mr heaton-harri , pay particular attention to the show of hand .
i hope to see many hand raise when the time come to vote .
( parliament approve the commission proposal )
( parliament approve the commission proposal )
procedure without debate :
( parliament approve the legislative resolution )
. ( fr ) the european union be apparently finance through four own resource .
since then , community vat fraud and distortion in the calculation of gdp , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have have a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of community resource .
since then , of course , this europe with pretension to federalism be now more than ever finance like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually be , but which it refuse to see itself as .
this can be clearly see in the regulation before us .
it show a concern with the accounting involve own resource , the process of making them available or with the monitor of declare amount made available to the commission .
furthermore , the new advisory committee that have be create be made up of representative of the taxpay member state .
this be a long way from offshoot such as the " community criminal code " , the " european public prosecutor " or a european police force , with olaf .
there be as yet no federal european tax .
all the same , a europe with 25 member will be want a european tax on income , if not on profit , or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 2025 .
koch report ( a5-0105 / 1999 )
- ( fr ) it be with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improve harmonisation in the train of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good .
in recent year , the transportation of dangerous good nationally and internationally have increase considerably , increasing the risk of accident .
some of these risk be due to a inadequate awareness of the risk inherent in such transportation .
it therefore prove necessary , in the context of establish the internal market , to adopt some measure intend to ensure better risk prevention. directive 96 / 35 / ec be a response to this requirement .
in order to facilitate achieve this objective , directive 96 / 35 / ec provide for the appointment of safety adviser for dangerous good who would have appropriate professional train .
this professional train would be target at awareness of the term of the legislation , regulation and administrative condition applicable to such transport .
while this represent significant progress at the time , the lack of specific term governing the harmonisation of examination requirement prove to be a problem .
the commission proposal seek to ensure that the train of safety adviser be standardise .
it outline the minimum content of examination and define the role of the authorise body as well as the requirement demand of the examine body .
parliament vote in favour of this text .
in order to be realistic , i further support postpone the date for the application of these condition until three month after the directive itself come into force .
koch report ( a5-0104 / 1999 )
last october i express my view on the hatzidaki report on the transport of dangerous good by rail .
the view i shall express today be not far remove from those i have then .
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous good by road come into force on 1 january 1997 .
this include a number of interim condition valid until 1 january 1999 .
this be the time when we should have express our opinion of the commission proposal to put a end to the derogation .
the cen have be unable to complete its work in the time allot .
this be exactly what happen in the case of transport of such good by rail , except for the fact that a time limit have be decide .
right now we do not have the slight idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposal .
until then , there be really no point in member state amend their national regulation .
the report also accept that some flexibility may be adopt , and grant state the option of adopt or apply alternative standard .
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standard regard certain type of pressure vessel use for transportation , where there be no applicable european standard .
they may also adopt alternative condition for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wish to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
schroedter report ( a5-0108 / 1999 )
mr president , i want to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development .
i would urge both the member state and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparity in wealth which continue to exist between the different region in europe .
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparity in employment continue to give cause for concern .
despite the fact that the community , through the structural fund among others , inject considerable sum into combate the disparity between regional development opportunity in europe , these disparity continue to exist .
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affair .
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
i want it to be clear that though i vote in favour of the report , i have this important reservation .
- the schroedter report speak of the need to promote partnership with regard to the spend of eu structural fund in europe for the period 2000-2006 .
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster , i have always support the need for the implementation of bottom-up scheme support by national eu fund .
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu government cannot alone decide on specific spend priority .
i believe that local authority and group from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involve in the decision-making process for the spend of european structural fund .
the leader iii scheme be set to be implement some time later this year .
the leader programme at its core afford a opportunity for public , private and voluntary group to pool their collective talent so as to create long-term and sustainable job in small and medium-sized enterprise in rural area .
this be a classic example of how the partnership concept operate and such scheme must be support in its broad remit .
the european peace and reconciliation fund have also be a success in create job in border county in ireland .
once again , there be active participation from group from the private , public and voluntary sector which suggest how best particular fund can be spent so as to help different local job creation project within this region .
during the next round of eu structural fund 2000-2006 , other eu initiative such as " equal " and " urban " will be operating .
these initiative must also involve the participation of local authority and local community in a effort to identify where best european structural fund should be spent .
the rapporteur refer to the need to implement a integrate approach to new eu structural fund plan and programme .
they must promote a decentralise , efficient and comprehensive partnership base on the skill and commitment of all sector in regional and local authority .
this be very sensible because key economic and social difficulty in our country cannot be overcome unless there be key integration between national , european and local fund .
. ( fr ) this report take us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparity between region , of course .
but more especially because , even though at first sight the european market guarantee us improve function of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
jacque delor be accustom to saying that the market be short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparity .
it be precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lie behind the european social model , which we be all in favour of , and which give rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
mrs schroedter have s report mark a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
this be the reason for the request which we be putt forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member state , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
in order to do so , the monitor committee must be open to include member of the european parliament , association and industrialist concern by the project and also civil society .
these guideline represent a step towards the improve effectiveness of community structural aid .
amend again as such by the schroedter report , they be a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that be another subject. in the meantime , let us support this first step .
- this report call for drastic cut in the level of illegal state aid dish out by some member state .
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminate altogether .
in my mind , illegal state aid amount to little more than state-sponsor social dumping .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrate by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrate by government .
if we be to have a effective single market that make european industry globally competitive and generate wealth and employment for all european , then we must have a level play field .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroy competitive company and create unemployment .
there be , of course , case when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping company restructure .
in all such case , however , strict criterion must be met and prior approval from the european commission gain .
whether we be talk about beef to france or about backhander to industry , eu member state must not be allow to flout the law .
i enthusiastically support the report be proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per member state .
country that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rule should be name and shame and their hypocrisy reveal .
member state cannot be allow to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that level of state aid to industry in europe appear to be fall .
much remains to be do , however , and i call on the commission to be far tough in expose the subsidy junky of europe .
unfortunately , the european commission have already move ahead with its guideline and parliament have s position on the programme for 2000-2006 do not carry much weight .
this must be do with the objective of achieve economic and social cohesion .
the truth be though , that the commission have s guideline do not fully meet these objective .
in the first place , if administrative procedure be not simplify , it will be hard to attain community objective on reform , with a view to great efficiency and concentration .
a considerable stumble block be the fact that the region and other operator find it impossible and be incapable of making plan in time .
this be why the mid-term review , provide for under article 42 of regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
in general , the current guideline cannot be consider as clear or transparent .
that said , the differ approach adopt in the guideline , which be not gear to geographical objective , but rather to policy area , can be consider as positive .
we could say that , in this state of affair , we have once again miss the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
rural area must truly be see as a resource which should be increasingly invest in , by encourage young people to remain in rural area in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .
i must also stress that once again the commission be , in fact , skirt the issue of practical action on equal opportunity .
in conclusion , the document be not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspect be disappointing .
berend report ( a5-0107 / 1999 )
. ( pt ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thought put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the european union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlight a few issue .
this situation show that it would be a mistake to leave adopt measure for promote employment to the exclusive internal control of the member state , which be what the report propose .
. ( fr ) the berend report give us a interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the region of the european union .
expenditure become a end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
the statistics publish by the european commission in its sixth report do however show , as mr berend point out , the limitation of the policy being implement :
the poor region be gradually making good their underdevelopment .
in 1986 , the average of the 10 poor region amount to 41 % of the overall community gnp .
in 1996 it be 50 % .
progress be particularly mark in portugal and ireland .
this be a generalise tendency , sparing neither the rhône-alpe , nor alsace .
it have be confirm in sweden and finland , country where unemployment have in fact increase to a worrying degree over the last few year , as in many region of the unite kingdom .
it may therefore seem strange that , when the structural fund be reform , objective 2 , dedicate to industrial and rural area undergo economic restructure , should have be sacrifice in favour of objective 1 and 3 .
for the period 1999-2006 , the total appropriation for this objective will be ecu 22.5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999 .
base as it be on such choice , it be to be doubt whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the member state of the european union .
von wogau report ( a5-0069 / 1999 )
as a example i would give the restructure of abb alsthom power. a sizeable delegation of employee of this firm from throughout europe be visit strasbourg today .
the management of abb alsthom power , following a merger carry out in june 1999 , announce restructure where there be already the prospect of layoff in a number of country .
this damage situation for employment raise many question , particularly regard the information give to the european work council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggest that the community directive on european work council must be update and strengthen .
it also require the monitor of merger taking employment , the environment and consumer into consideration .
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affair do not go far enough in this respect , i abstain .
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve high cost for member state .
but it do , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting option for development of the european union .
admittedly , this reform be one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantle .
indeed , the white paper envisage that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament have just vote on , support it in so doing .
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval cause by enlargement may lead to community competence being limit and subsidiarity being extend .
it be a quite different europe which be taking shape in the long term .
be this not , indeed , what be so distressing to some socialist member of the european parliament ?
the german social democrat vote against the von wogau report because , in their view , it might break up european policy on competition , which be to say , in plain term , attack the standardising superstate .
curiously , a number of employer agree with them , prefer the european " one-stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
indeed , this be one advantage of the present system .
rapkay report ( a5-0078 / 1999 )
the member of parliament from the lutte ouvrière party shall not be vote in favour of these report on european competition policy .
competition be a war which have major concern fighting each other , which constantly take the form of layoff , factory closure , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
we see a further example of this with the plan layoff in europe propose by the corporation abb alsthom power .
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the european union , despite its being one of the wealthy region in the world : these be the result of this competition which the european institution intend to promote .
this be repulsive most of all in social term .
- ( fr ) in vote against this report , we be acting as spokesperson for all the man and woman who in seattle and throughout europe express their rejection of a world reduce to strict commercial logic .
this report be essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it be not competition that can solve the problem facing humanity at this turn of the century .
whether it be a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition be a factor increasing regression and insecurity .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe be victim of too reticent a application of this competition policy ?
we be convince that the opposite be true , and we do not think that state aid be by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criterion of efficiency ?
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?
only the legal adviser to multinational could demonstrate such stubbornness .
jonckheer report ( a5-0087 / 1999 )
i be happy with the rapporteur have s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .
there be too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure cause distortion in competition .
admittedly , a effective competition policy be a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
clearly though , it must be monitor , a task which fall to the european commission .
the aid which union member state allocate each year to the sector under consideration reach a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40 % allocate to the manufacturing sector .
this aid be considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
this downturn in aid be chiefly due to the reduction in aid grant to the new german länder .
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figure give in the report do not cover all state aid .
the european commission must make good these omission as soon as possible .
it must also cooperate with the member state in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which be to say in time for the ninth report .
i think it would be a good idea if the commission publish a register specify the amount of state aid per member state .
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament have be totally exclude from the advisory committee on state aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be oblige to make regular report to us .
this be why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft business in the beneficiary country .
langen report ( a5-0073 / 1999 )
in the important debate on competition this morning , i express my view on mr langen have s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code .
just as the court of justice recognise in its order of 3 may 1996 , the iron and steel industry be particularly sensitive to disturbance to its competitive operation .
this , indeed , be the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .
at the same time , it be , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition condition or of the market , hence the importance of regulate such aid .
it be therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid grant in the event of plant closure .
in the same way , it be vital for member state to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid grant to their steel undertaking , as stipulate under article 7 of the steel aid code .
the commission suggest that member state submit their report within a time limit of two month following the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminder .
like the rapporteur , i be please with the commission report , but i do deplore the fact that the report do not cover every aspect of the aid .
in the interest of equality , there be ground to either apply the steel aid code strictly or modify the code if the commission wish to authorise type of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
finally , we have the problem of the consequence of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continue beyond 2002 .
my feeling in this respect be that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure a official ban on any aid not cover by the code .
for all these reason i vote in favour of the langen report , and i now await the commission have s response to our request and demand .
( the sitting be suspend at 1.05 p.m. and resume at 3 p.m. )
oil slick off the french coast
the next item be the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .
mr president , i shall be speak on behalf of the ppe-de group , but also as a elect representative for brittany , and i be therefore directly concern and shock by these event .
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe-de group , we table a motion for a resolution .
i be please to see that we have today arrive at a compromise motion .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occur along the american coastline , and why ?
if , i repeat , we have have regulation of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occur .
this be why we think that the applicable legislation must be review , particularly the 1992 protocol which have exempt the shipowner , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .
well , if the charterer be exonerate , then of course he be less concern with the inspection which oil company be responsible for .
the regulation must therefore be review , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlight the inadequate feature of current european regulation .
moreover , as you said , monitor must above all be step up : that of the flag state , that of the classification society .
you told us that rina be a italian classification register recognise by the commission .
what be the condition for this recognition ?
what guarantee be there of its reliability ?
you be going to commission a fact-finding mission .
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspection by the maritime authority and supervision within european port must also be tighten up .
this obligation be not respect either in france or in many other european country .
why not ?
what conclusion have the commission already draw or what conclusion be it going to draw ?
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer be responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
if the charterer have s liability entail a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforce to a great extent .
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authority in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the coastguard who supervise the coast of the unite state .
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleague in my group who approach this particular problem jointly with their transport team .
this disaster be both a transport and environmental one and be not confine to one area .
here we be here again in this parliament discuss yet another maritime disaster .
i could reel off the list of disaster that have afflict this industry in my 10 year in this parliament but i only have three minute .
how many more erika do we have to endure before the power that be deliver to us a proper port state control that be effective throughout the whole of the european union , not just certain area of it ?
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry deliver us tanker with segregate tank and double hold ?
how many more seabird be to die before shipping company end the practice of cleaning their tank at sea which , as our resolution point out , cause far more pollution than any erika-type disaster ?
we need the member state to act quickly and decisively .
the erika cost no human live but it may have ruin many human livelihood .
just as the sea empress , just as the braer do .
it be absolutely certain that all three left us with a ecological disaster .
the time for resolution have pass .
what be now need be action .
sadly , i fear , the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discuss yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
mr president , every time there be a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
in reality we can never stop accident happening at sea , but it be incumbent upon us all to learn the lesson whenever a incident of this kind take place and apply those lesson to reduce risk in future .
the " erika " incident be serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affect , but it be devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .
some say that it be the worst accident that have ever befall the bird life of this part of europe .
the royal society for the protection of bird believe that as many as 400,000 bird , perhaps mainly guillemot , may have die .
the picture many of us will have see of oil-soak bird being put down by veterinary official be both distressing and tragic .
we all want the high standard for ship whatever flag they may be flying .
the thought of a incident of this kind occur in the near future should concentrate her mind and the mind of her official wonderfully .
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift .
with every tide , the volunteer , member of the arm force and firemen remove great pancake of this thick , sticky , black tar .
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? "
indeed this disaster involve the erika , like that of the russian vessel in turkey , moreover , be unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology be available .
it be all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty year after the amoco cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many time since , " never again ! "
it be , of course , the responsibility of policy , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizen that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika be one disaster too many .
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refuse to use the erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstance , be the liability of total as charterer not recognise ?
your proposal must also include making double hull mandatory and enforce observance , at last , of the ban on degas at sea .
a european inspection body must be establish which can monitor the condition of vessel effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it be also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .
what point be there in issue restrictive directive if , once they be at sea , most vessel do just what they wish ?
i can testify to this remarkable work .
you be no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 bird be going to die as a result of this oil slick , which be a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
in relation to this , you be no doubt also aware how difficult it be nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural space .
and , on this subject , commissioner , you do not mention how the commission intend to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitat .
once again , there will be no clearly define party responsible. in the meantime , it be nature that be taking the rap , as always .
many volunteer from france and other european country have express their solidarity by lend a hand to the victim in the field .
our proposal be particularly concern with the age of oil tanker .
among those inspect and found to be in contravention of regulation last year , 15 be at least 20 year old and some be 30 and more .
this be no longer tolerable .
next , we have flag of convenience .
accord to the international transport federation , over 40 % of the ship wreck in 1998 be sailing under flag of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human being at the expense of safety .
this be no longer tolerable .
finally , there be the lack of transparency .
everything be do to make the line of responsibility , the identity of the owner and real decision-maker as impenetrable as possible .
this be no longer tolerable .
we must also ensure increase strictness both in issue sea-worthiness certificate and in monitor the condition and the maintenance of vessel .
finally we must ensure that all the party responsible for disaster contribute to repair the damage cause .
i be thinking specifically of total-fina in the present instance .
this be a approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .
in so doing , it will have prove its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , be await clear , tangible action .
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have see a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
quite clearly , we be now paying the price for our lack of concern .
it be absolutely essential to put a end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterer , untraceable shipowner and lenient certification company .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
admittedly , there be the international oil pollution compensation fund , iopcf , but it water down the issue of liability and set its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be review .
the question of flag of convenience must be review within the imo .
it be up to the member state and the community to take the necessary initiative to achieve this .
let me remind you that the erika be sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state apply for membership of the european union .
in addition , there be community directive , but they be seldom apply , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspector .
this omission must be remedy as a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety have be in preparation for many year , but it be making very slow progress .
the commission be display intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcoming .
the date when the commission be suppose to present its communication devote to this key issue be put off time and again. it be now schedule for july .
the term of the regulation to be enforce must be particularly clear and strict .
i shall mention three issue that our group feel be priority .
firstly , the liability of owner of oil cargo must be clearly establish and the victim of pollution incident must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community water must be enforce as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessel to be give access to community water must be establish in the near future. this could be of a maximum of 15 year of age .
thus , the erika be refuse access to american water .
if the european community have do the same , a great disaster would have be avoid .
let us ensure , mr president , commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media hype and the shock of this house have die down .
mr president , torrey canyon , olympic bravery , haven , amoco cadiz , gino , tanio , so many name we remember with horror .
and now the erika .
whose turn be next ? twenty one year after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , show the irresponsibility of our successive ruler .
the atlantic west coast once again be paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinational .
and this be the result .
as a elect representative for the loire-atlantique region , unfortunately , i can testify to this .
there be nothing natural about these recurring disaster , they be the result of fate .
they be the result of human thoughtlessness .
what we have here be a ecological disaster .
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass root could have any doubt about that .
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get member of parliament involve in the team of expert which have just be announce by the commission ?
next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regard identification of the exact characteristic of good transport .
in fact , accord to the expert , the oil the erika be carry be suppose to sink to the bottom and should never have reach the coast .
we know what actually happen .
next , reliable technical inspection must be establish like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicle more than five year old .
we must regulate the use of flag of convenience , make double hull mandatory for the transport of pollute or dangerous material , work on technological innovation in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbon at sea .
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
i have also table a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group .
mr president , in the course of the last few year there have be a succession of serious tanker disaster world-wide and the countermeasure take have either be ineffective or not worth mention .
it be particularly bad this time , not least because it have affect a major european state ; a incident which could happen again at any time .
we urgently require a directive if we be to reduce these risk .
the 15 clearly do not suffice .
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the european union again .
all those involve , including the transport agent , be responsible for any ensue damage , and these individual be to provide satisfactory assurance .
this be the only way of afford the victim the opportunity to make their claim for compensation .
however , we must aim high in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
in other word , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
many thanks for this .
this also mean that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action point which she announce today .
the erika disaster show that when sound traffic and transport regulation be lack at international and european level , nature and the environment come off second-best .
the damage suffer , also in ecological term , cannot be express in money .
hence also this joint debate involve transport and environmental management member .
what i learned be that , actually , there be sufficient legislation in place but the problem be the lack of supervision .
could i highlight a few point which have also be touch upon by the commissioner ?
first of all , the port-state control , accord to which 25 % of all ship require inspection .
i think that this 25 % should not only be enforce but that it should also be ensure that more inspection take place .
so this 25 % should be increase .
but this be not in place .
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .
finally , as far as the technical requirement for ship be concern , some member have already mention just now that , since 1999 in the unite state , ship should in any case be double-hull .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which come into effect in 2001 , should be look at very closely .
mr president , we have already have this discussion so many time in the past .
we have achieve nothing so far , and we have be unable to reach agreement within the european union .
allow me to say first that what we be talk about be a environmental catastrophe , which also impact on the economy and threaten livelihood .
so what be we to do now ?
i have no intention of talk about past event ; rather i want to look to the future .
what be we to do now ?
i will tell you a few thing we should do .
of course , we need double-hull vessel .
that go without saying , but it be something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
so what do we need to happen immediately ?
we need technical test of ship , that be obligatory technical test every two year , and no ship to be operate without the accompany certificate .
we need this at european level and internationally ; we need something like a tüv , a organisation that undertake technical test of motor vehicle in germany , which be compulsory every two year .
if you do not have a certificate then you be not allow to operate the vehicle .
this be what we need for ship .
thirdly , we need to carry out check on these safety and insurance certificate in the port , that be in every port of the european union .
any failure to produce these certificate must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibit from leave the port , regardless of all the port charge .
we must reach agreement here , in all the european union have s port , from marseilles , through to rotterdam , to wilhelmshaven , cuxhaven , and wherever ship drop anchor .
we also need the country whose flag the ship fly to bear liability .
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship be flying will accept liability .
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
i can assure you that those country award flag would then take great care to avoid have to accept liability .
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
environmental standard will be a recurring theme .
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirement will lead to job loss in the port .
the union will have something to say as will industry .
a long memory will serve us well , lady and gentlemen .
i be look at all those of you who have not exactly be at the forefront of the environmental movement .
just you go home and say : " we have not concern ourselves with standard to date " .
we need to have a long memory when it come to the demand being made in the port .
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few year have time !
mr president , mrs roth-behrendt express very many of my own thought .
we have now obtain a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measure .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster have led ?
i would compare the situation with a early generation have s introduction of the plimsoll line , a marking which be introduce to prevent insurance fraud involve inferior vessel .
where be the sense of crisis which generation before us have ?
i consider that what we should adopt be the form of certification that mrs roth-behrendt speak about , the identification in the form of green mark on tanker which certain harbour in europe have brought up for discussion .
we must also critically examine the classification society .
i do not think that we can accept their procedure .
we need independent procedure and procedure involve public control .
within the commission , the one hand do not know what the other hand be doing .
it be not a acceptable procedure that measure to improve the environment , which be in keeping with the commission have s guideline , cannot be take because these be consider to constitute prohibit aid to shipyard .
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage cause by the oil slick .
how be it possible not to be outrage when a bank refuse to divulge the name of the erika have s owner on the ground of professional confidentiality , without government react ?
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and bank , even though this same confidentiality serve to conceal what be essentially criminal action .
in these circumstance , even the best resolution will remain little more than appeal to principle which be powerless to limit the great corporation have capacity to cause damage .
mr president , i be in favour of tighten up the legislation on port state control and on classification society .
however , we must stick to the fact .
the ship erika have be investigate four time in the course of the last two year .
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigation but rather in guarantee the rigour with which the control be undertake .
i have heard in the course of the discussion that have take place in the last few week that the member state do not have enough money to undertake the control .
i cannot accept this .
if the member state decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ship be to be monitor on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
this can only be detect if control undertake be more rigorous .
it should be our goal to ensure that port state control be not superficial , but include material test .
secondly , i also share the commissioner have s observation and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
if it should become apparent that one or more classification company have provide report by way of favour then they should be struck off the list of authorise classification company .
that be the only deterrent we have for prevent other classification company from following suit .
mrs roth-behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety test ) for ship in the form of the classification company .
there be reputable company too .
mr president , commissioner , the erika sink near my home and be still there , with 20 000 tonne in its hold , the fate of which we be wait to discover .
it could have sunk anywhere .
my first thought be for the 26 indian sailor , who be save but of whom nothing have be said .
there could have be death in this disaster and safety at sea mean , above all , man have s live .
by now they be far away .
it be a miracle that they be save .
in particular , we must ensure that classification society be compel to make their report public , as currently , we do not have access to them .
then , sanction must be harmonise between the 15 member state ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the union .
we must be tough on vessel flying flag of convenience , not because they be necessarily bad boat , but because amongst these boat there be many bad one .
we must improve information on all of the world have s ship , but provision have already be made for this. we must also target those responsible and take a tough line with them .
with regard to this matter , i would like to know who own the erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law be one thing , but there be always real shareholder in the background .
where be the erika have s owner ?
perhaps they be in lovely villa by lovely beach , get a nice tan .
we would like to know their name and their face .
finally , there must be improvement in the train of crew .
in our society there be no such thing as zero-risk , but we must at least ensure the great possible level of safety .
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .
have spent a lot of time at sea myself i be well aware of the sea be power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ship and boat essential .
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who be deal with the consequence of the break up and sink of the oil tanker erika .
this have be a environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resource .
this suggest to me that we should also look to the shipowner , to the flag state and the inspection authority to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measure and new regulation , let us look carefully at the existing arrangement to be sure that they be being properly implement .
better to heed call to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposal .
in that context i support call to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
i support call to ensure that the classification society effectively monitor vessel have structural condition and be held accountable for their action .
call for design improvement in hull construction , especially double-hull vessel , be sensible but take time to be implement throughout the fleet .
they be no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleague , mainly in the committee on transport and the environment , who have not forget that this disaster also affect the fishing industry .
these be the same area , commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activity of certain shipowner who empty the bilge of their vessel off their coast , without any control whatsoever .
i come from a region , galicia , which have suffer similar accident in the past .
in this regard , the current process of negotiation on malta have s accession to the european union must be use to ensure that this country rigorously monitor the oil tanker which sail under its flag .
on the other hand , prevention be essential .
portugal be a country which have clearly demonstrate its sensitivity to issue relate to the sea .
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lack in resource , have battle courageously against the grave effect that this disaster have have on coastal region , the marine ecosystem and european fishing stock .
in addition , i should like to make a number of comment :
first , the commission be right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina , the italian shipping register , because we need to know if community law be apply .
that should be the start point for our effort .
once we have do that , our reaction to the ecological disaster be fully justify .
commissioner , i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measure which be being adopt and implement .
commissioner , i believe that it be time to opt for the safe technically possible measure .
it be therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other country .
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
any cost-benefit analysis which truly take into account all the harm occasion to person and the environment by these accident , be bound to support this approach .
i think that give the dramatic circumstance , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several vote .
the commissioner have suggest three main chapter which need to be draft and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standard .
we sometimes regulate thing which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
in this area we must respond to public opinion .
this be extremely important and everyone should feel concern because we be , when all be said and do , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
therefore , once our legislation have be brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
we must also put in place systematic control and finally apply the have polluter pay have principle of responsibility which be , of course , suppose to be a deterrent .
i hope that all political group will support us in our request for a public hearing .
the implication for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment be enormous .
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weaken structure of the oil tanker .
so people be doubtful about the safety of ship which carry dangerous or pollute good .
the international maritime organisation have issue international rule in this connection .
state can carry out port inspection .
in europe , legislation be strict and it be compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessel accord to the port-state control directive .
however , it seem that none of the member state meet this figure due to a lack of inspector .
it be clear that there be no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the commissioner be quite right .
where the scheme falter be in the enforcement of existing legislation .
but how be we now going to enforce this if there be indeed a lack of inspector , esteem european commission ?
can the commission provide a assurance that directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirement for vessel bound for or leave community port and carry dangerous or pollute good will be implement correctly in all member state ?
should its implementation not be more strictly monitor ?
in short , to give priority to old sub-standard ship over ship which meet all quality requirement .
the erika be built at a japanese shipyard and be single-hull .
there be four more sister ship in service at present .
construction of this type of ship be halt at the time because the risk of rust be especially high .
some of them also sail under the maltese flag .
be we wait for the next accident to happen ?
would sanction not be appropriate , as the commissioner state , for the classification society ?
rina be currently the talk of the town .
malta be enter the accession negotiation .
in my opinion , the european union can only accept malta if it be guarantee that the maltese flag will sail without a accident in future .
like so many others , i too wonder where the people responsible be .
where be the shipowner and those who order the shipment when these disaster occur ?
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establish a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
this be not the first time we have see oil slick , whether intentional or unintentional .
( the president cut the speaker off )
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleague for bring this motion before parliament .
the environmental disaster of the sink of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonne of oil have be widely report in the british media .
although britain and france have have their difference recently , i can assure you that there be considerable sympathy in my country for all those affect .
i salute these joint effort to repair the damage .
this be clearly a problem for all eu coastline which will require imaginative solution .
there be currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market pick up the tab .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
moreover , although i be not oppose to shipowner register their vessel in their country of choice , i believe there be a need for strict application of international regulation .
i sincerely hope that , particularly during the french presidency later this year , the commission and the council will look carefully at all these option , and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament .
the victim be wait outside .
they want answer .
they do not want any more promise that we then fail to keep , or to see any effort that we then fail to follow through .
the citizen be right to ask : " do our region now count amongst those which be lost forever ? "
who will provide us with new job ?
that be why i welcome mrs palacio have s action plan with open arm .
it be equally important to note that " prevention be better than cure " .
but there be a art to that as well .
deploy the german multipurpose ship " neuwerk " - it be right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entail the swift provision of european neighbourly help .
we be particularly in the debt of those who undertake the difficult deployment of all their crew .
valuable experience be gain , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disaster use state-of-the-art technology alone .
we be therefore right to demand improve control , sanction and preventive measure .
i have be fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten year , here in parliament .
the issue be as topical as it be before .
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow mep , to bring about improvement and logical solution within the framework of european and international cooperation .
i would like to tell you that , in fact , it be not just a environmental problem - it be a very important environmental problem - but it be also a very important social problem .
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .
mrs roth-behrendt said that nothing have ever be do .
in fact , i believe that thing have be do by the commission , but there be still more to do .
during these year , the emphasis have mainly be on the safety of passenger transport .
that be the reality .
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problem , also derive from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous good in the maritime sector .
flag of convenience be one problem , but be not the only one .
the romanian flag be not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country have a extremely high number of incidence at inspection ; more than the country with flag of convenience .
malta and cyprus have ask to join the community .
we must be demanding on this issue and we be negotiate to this end .
this will oblige us to reconsider the register in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .
i believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the register of the european union country .
we already have legislation .
accord to the information which the commission service have give me , this legislation be not adequately apply in many member state due to a lack of personnel , mean and inspector .
unfortunately , the 25 % often consist of flag which be expect to fulfil the requirement : in this way inspection be quick and the work be carry out more easily .
lastly , i would like to stress the issue of liability .
not only in term of maximum sum insure , which i believe should be similar to those in the unite state .
we have set a figure of us 180 million ; in the unite state they be talk about us 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claim payment .
unless we require that the owner of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problem .
i will end now. i will not expand further .
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasion .
the political will of this parliament be require - and i can see that i can count on this - as well as that of the council of minister .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we have take good note of your intention .
i have receive 8 motion for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present commission statement .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12.00 p.m.
storm in europe
the next item be the commission statement on the storm in europe .
mr barny have the floor on behalf of the commission .
i think that you must have do so , because you have not mention it .
in fact , we all know that anyone who do not live within the perimeter of a objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
let me explain .
i be in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroy around 20 % of deciduous forest .
indeed , for some have forestry have district , which have lost 20 % of their tree , this represent a huge loss .
the town concern estimate that it will be spread over 40 year .
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural town through subsidy for loss in their financial revenue .
i think that this be something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policy .
it be true that the problem of the forestry sector be a extremely complex one .
indeed , you spoke of release fund for timber storage on the ground that its price must not depreciate .
on the other hand , district which have not be affect by the storm will also suffer , as the national forestry office have decide to freeze cut in forestation for four year .
those district which have not suffer loss will therefore see their income decrease in any case .
i be telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem be , and i thank the commission once again for extend their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there have indeed be a economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophe be still to come .
as you yourself said , commissioner , these disaster or storm do not always have natural cause , and we think that these be the first sign of climate change .
we should therefore review our policy in order to take account of this fact .
what can the member of the european parliament do when face with such a widespread disaster ?
firstly , i would like to pay tribute to the mayor and local representative who , on a daily basis , have have to reassure their constituent , organise volunteer and cooperate with the public service .
they have earn the confidence of their fellow-citizen .
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authority and individual state from coming to the assistance of business affect by the disaster by apply community competition rule too strictly .
i be thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish company , which have be particularly badly hit .
as you said , commissioner , we must ensure that there be compensation for the force cessation in activity and that appeal can be made to fifg for investment that have be totally wipe out .
beyond this , i think that implement magp in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal region that have be affect .
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investment , which they urgently need .
it seem quite natural that give such a disaster , national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastate region and those people who have be worst affect .
these be the term of the write answer you give mr martinez on 11 january 2000 .
i can show you a copy if you wish .
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which be allocate to us for natural disaster .
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriation and we must change the forestry policy implement in most country in the union. that , however , be another problem altogether .
mr president , commissioner , europe have undergo a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolence to the family in mourning as a result of the appalling weather condition that devastate europe in december .
these storm be a unprecedented ecological disaster for our forest .
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forest in my region , lorraine , which have suffer enormous destruction .
i would like to congratulate the regional authority , the volunteer and the public service on the fantastic way in which they rally round but , unfortunately , their trouble be not yet over .
it be europe be duty to support them and thereby complement the effort of the government of member state affect by the disaster .
i welcome mr barny have s statement and i also welcome the measure which the commission have announce .
i be certainly not forget the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry have be devastate and a whole population be suffering the tragic effect of this .
the community action programme for civil protection , establish by a council decision on 9 december , be launch on 1 january 2000 .
i ask member state to grasp this opportunity. this programme must work at full capacity .
although it may have be effective in certain area - and i do not doubt the sincerity of commissioner barny have s word - unfortunately it be still in its infancy when it come to forestry .
our priority , as we wait for community-level fund to be free up , be for material aid in term of partnership exchange between member state .
it be therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest road , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
lend forestry equipment and making personnel qualify in forestry management available be also cover by this measure .
finally , it be essential that we slow down the log of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfall .
these timber sale should be support by strong media coverage in member state .
this aid for gathering timber be , of course , only the first stage of a aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural area .
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be manage now that the emergency be over .
this be a very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this play in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economy .
it be therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member state in the face of a ecological and economic calamity .
if this solidarity be to have be worthwhile , it be up to europe to propose priority action for safeguard the timber industry .
current programme must be accelerate .
for example , as they stand , the commission have s programme will preclude us from meeting our obligation under kyoto .
the trade in emission right be immoral to my mind and rather than solve the problem , it shelve it .
the entire taxation system must be give a environmental perspective in the medium term .
we must work more rapidly towards achieve the target stipulate in the white paper for renewable energy source , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gas .
the new commission have not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it have put forward be woefully inadequate !
commissioner , mr president , lothar be a quite ordinary name hitherto .
however , it have now achieve notoriety .
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claim numerous victim , mainly in france and germany , but also in switzerland , leave a trail of destruction in its wake .
the wind triumph over electricity pylon , roof , traffic sign and , ultimately over the forest .
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metre of solid timber , and this be only a estimate .
i have listen to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arm the fact that you be intend to go and see for yourself the effect the catastrophe have have in france and in germany .
if mrs schrey be to visit the black forest sometime in the next few day , then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as a individual .
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happen not to be in a objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
all this be well-intentioned advice .
however , i come from a area in northern germany where the forestry industry predominate and i can tell you that we be already feeling the effect of the immense damage .
the thinning-out we need be not being attend to ; the forest be not being tend to the requisite degree .
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency be to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raise again at a later date .
mr president , commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two fact .
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , nato , with the participation of most member state of the european union , flatten kosovo with bomb in the name of freedom .
we be now endeavour , at huge cost , to get the country back on its foot again and help its people , and rightly so .
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storm rage bring death and destruction to vast tract of the eu .
the commission in brussels respond to the victim have cry for help with a shrug of shoulder .
" we do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .
this be wrong !
and no one can comprehend this attitude .
certainly those who fear for their livelihood be at a complete loss .
the citizen of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .
i say they have a right to solidarity .
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hour of need .
i urge the commission not to keep have to be ask and to provide assistance for the victim of the storm .
it know the in and out of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
the european union need rule governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public have to foot the bill for damage that have often be cause by individual involve in criminal machination .
we must make the perpetrator liable for all manner of damage do to our environment .
then , for example , people will think twice before transport oil in a tanker that be about to fall apart .
when , in 1994 , over five year ago that be , i join the legal affair committee in this parliament , i become rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
to this day i be still await a initiative from the commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
it be a scandalous state of affair that must be end with all haste , and i hope that february do not see this dossier being postpone yet again !
mr president , commissioner , the storm that take place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problem .
it have become clear that mankind continue to be unable to avoid natural disaster .
there have always be natural disaster and there always will be .
of course , there be a need for solidarity here .
there be certainly a need for european civil protection , and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disaster .
the extent of the damage cause on this occasion be determine by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monoculture , if we be talk forest .
of course , i be in favour of providing assistance where we can .
but when it come to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be place on lay electricity and telephone cable underground .
we must take account of small cycle and plant stable mix woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monoculture .
the most important subject for discussion in this context be the climate .
to this day , we in europe remain in the privileged position of have the gulf stream , and the gulf stream still do its stuff .
america and south-east asia be have a much worse time of it as far as climate and storm go .
we be fortunate in have the gulf stream .
but in common with others , we too be have to endure the greenhouse effect .
this be partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it be to demonstrate climate change use calculation .
we must take more account of the guideline produce at the kyoto environmental conference .
we must reduce co2 emission , employ renewable energy , and generally make enquiry , in this connection , as to how the forest of europe be fare .
mr president , i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victim .
this be a irreparable loss .
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the french department and citizen , and the solidarity of other country with france , which be the country worst affect .
as i have little time , mr president , i would like to touch upon two element of our resolution .
i believe that the first one be implicitly recognise by the commissioner in his speech when he wonder whether these catastrophe be natural or not .
that be to say that expert be ever more convince that climate change and human activity , in general term , be link to the increase see in natural disaster in recent year .
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature have rise more than in the rest of the century .
therefore europe must be clearly commit to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposal .
secondly , i be rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner have s proposal to create a european civil protection body .
furthermore , we should utilise a extraordinary budget line , since this be a extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the family and community that lost member in this terrible tragedy .
it be really the loss of life that make this particular disaster a extraordinary one by european standard .
it be regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situation like this .
that be important .
the other thing we should remember be that we do have a budget line in the past .
it be very small .
it be not able to do very much but it be repeatedly abuse by member of this house propose action when the disaster be not even major .
official and minister from member state be coming to brussels , whisper with the commission and get a few euro and making a political point by bring aid back to their constituency .
so there be not much sympathy for this budget line when it be abolish .
i think we should reinstate this budget line .
when we have the earthquake in greece , which be a big disaster , the community have no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greek .
the same when the flood come in france and the same again now .
these be major disaster , we should have a instrument , we do not have it .
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rule tight so that only in situation where grave disaster occur will we call up this particular instrument .
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happen we have a instrument to deal with it .
we do not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have have many serious wind storm on the atlantic .
we have flood in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffer from these .
lady and gentlemen , none of us must forget what have take place .
it be true that there be a joint decision by the council and parliament seek to discontinue emergency line .
it be also true that there be a lot of european money around .
it be nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what be allocate before the storm will now be free up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
it be nothing more than the state play at taking from peter in order to give to paul .
mr president , commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storm occur in other part of the world with our own situation , we see that europe get off relatively lightly .
nevertheless , the storm that take place in the last week of december show us what the consequence can be and that there be major problem in store for us .
anyone travel to strasbourg by car or by rail would have be able to see for themselves that storm rage in alsace as well .
each and every one of us know that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now be to deal with the fall timber as swiftly as possible .
for it be common knowledge that we could have a even great disaster on our hand if the fall timber be to be left in the forest too long .
that be why it be absolutely essential to deal with the fall timber before the warm weather arrive .
decade will have go by before we be able to determine the true extent of the damage sustain by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it take a tree to grow .
the calculation be in decade rather than year .
i be therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry worker be also prepare .....
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i extend our deep sympathy to all of those who be affect by the storm .
sometimes within the community we do not actually have a awareness of what be happening in other country .
we have very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sink .
i be ask to highlight the result of the storm in ireland .
we have high wind and unprecedented , prolong rainfall which , add to existing difficulty , result in thousand of acre being submerge , sometimes , in up to 15 foot of water .
we experience the human misery of flood home and farm , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disaster of e.coli-infect water .
i talk with farmer whose ewe be abort their lamb due to drinking the infect water .
natural habitat be destroy .
so i ask that ireland be remember in this particular case .
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who express their solidarity with the storm victim .
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performance of this kind of major disaster in the future .
i believe now be the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , tom spencer .
he suggest that rather than give storm the name of man or woman , we should name them after the perpetrator of the greenhouse effect - he propose the oil company at the time .
i have receive seven motion for resolution table pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rule of procedure .
that conclude the debate .
the vote will be take at noon on thursday .
food safety
the next item be the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .
at my hearing last september , i promise speedy delivery of this white paper .
i be happy that we have be able to deliver so quickly .
the white paper represent three to four month of intensive work since the new commission be appoint last september .
it take on board the extensive consultation of the past couple of year since the commission be green paper on food law be publish .
equally it reflect our experience of recent food alert in such area as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .
the white paper also reflect the concern of this parliament which you have outline to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasion we have debate food safety in this house since the commission be appoint .
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe be food safety regime have be badly affect by the crisis and alert of recent year and month .
the commission be fully commit to restore that confidence by putt in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when i launch the white paper last week i said that the shopping trolley be one of the most potent weapon on the face of the earth .
the most discerning decision be made by the consumer of europe .
if their confidence be damage this be reflect in shopping decision .
this in turn have a dramatic effect on farmer , producer and industry generally .
in a industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence level can have significant effect .
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there be over 10 million employee .
high level of confidence be necessary to boost job number and competitiveness .
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless have one of the best food industry in the world and also one of the safe food control system .
the challenge be to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety be to put in place the necessary legislation and structure that will guarantee the high possible level of health protection for consumer arise from the consumption of food .
we be setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we be to achieve our ambition on schedule .
we will also need the full support from the council and other key stakeholder .
the white paper on food safety outline a comprehensive range of action need to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation .
all of these measure be design to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide great transparency to consumer .
the detail action plan on food safety in the white paper set a precise timetable for action over the next three year .
over 80 measure be envisage .
our objective be to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we be also envisage the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as a essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it have already attract much comment , including reaction from member of parliament .
the chapter of the white paper devote to the establishment of a european food authority be clearly design to elicit view and comment .
we be seek view by the end of april on what we envisage .
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moment .
the commission believe that major structural change be require in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objective of assure the high standard of food safety and restore consumer confidence .
why should a european food authority be a essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern be independence .
key stakeholder , including consumer , be seek a system that be independent and perceive to be independent of all vest interest .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of year since the reform system of scientific advice be adopt as a consequence of the bse crisis .
however , the commission believe that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committee devote to food safety will be transfer to the authority .
they may not be transfer in their present form or structure - this be a issue on which we will elicit view before making our definitive proposal on the authority be establishment .
however , if we be merely to propose a simple moving of deckchair , this would clearly not be enough .
as the white paper make clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
i be of the view that the existing system of scientific advice need to be strengthen .
within the authority i envisage much strong scientific and other support for the independent scientist .
i be also envisage that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issue before they become crisis .
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
to be proactive the white paper identify a number of new area that would be embrace by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong network with food safety agency and body in member state .
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating a enhance rapid alert system for food and feed concern .
the commission have decide that it be neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decision in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it be the correct one .
certainly there be those who would argue that we should give law-making power to such a authority .
i do not accept those view and reject them with some degree of passion .
it be only last year that the treaty be amend to give parliament a much great role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to a authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
i will be very interest to hear the view of parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there be also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
i also reject this line of argument .
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interest of europe be citizen ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific argument be soundly base , rationally argue and fully justify .
it seem difficult to envisage such a situation evolve .
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercise its risk management function , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
i have already said that the authority will be charge with develop network with national food safety agency and body in the member state .
this be a major task .
we must develop great certainty in the science that underpin food safety in the european union .
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issue .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence be gain in the authority itself .
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice base on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic network with national scientific body and agency , the authority will become pre-eminent on the european stage .
i be also anxious to hear the view of parliament in this regard .
the white paper also contain very important proposal in respect of control .
this be a hugely important component of the system of check and balance to ensure that member state and operator be comply with community legislation .
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we be also propose to strengthen significantly the control function carry out by the food and veterinary office locate in dublin .
this revise community framework would have three core element : operational criterion set up at community level , community control guideline , and enhance administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
these could include withhold community financial support or recoup fund already commit to a member state .
these proposal must be see as part of our mission to have the high food safety standard in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase market for farmer and producer in the union .
it set out over 80 separate action that be envisage over the period ahead and intend to close identify loophole in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminant and residue , novel food , additive , flavouring , packaging and irradiation .
as regard the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission be currently finalise a communication which i expect to be adopt very soon .
i look forward to have a useful exchange of view this afternoon with the member of parliament who would clearly have prefer to do this last week if there have be a appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , have regard to my contact with the president of the relevant committee , i recognise that this be not feasible .
but i know too that we will have many further opportunity in the coming month to consider the white paper be proposal on the authority .
we now have a number of month to have the necessary debate on the commission be idea on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority .
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .
parliament play a crucial role in europe be response to the bse crisis .
it have especially active since then in bring citizen have concern about food safety issue to the fore .
i expect that parliament be contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
while we have a number of month to the end of april to debate the issue and garner our view , i recognise fully that this be also a very tight timeframe .
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangement to ensure that its view can be formulate as quickly as possible .
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu be food safety regime in the year ahead .
it be essential that we get the mix right .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institution , including the commission and parliament .
that be very much the right approach .
but there be one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight .
i hope that we can thrash this out .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
it be very important that we include liability in that process .
that be the one word i be talk about .
the problem so far be that taxpayer paid when something go wrong .
that cannot continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there be a problem , those responsible be liable .
mr president , it be a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my question relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you be unclear about this in your white paper .
what be your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirement be apply to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitor thereof ?
the final part of my question be as follow : when will bse test be binding in all member state ?
that be another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you be somewhat unclear on in your white paper .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
i think the line that you have set up regard the food safety authority be a recognition of reality .
the member state would not accept a regulatory agency , so there be not very much point in your propose one .
some sector of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that be clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuff .
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from brussels and under-implementation in the member state ?
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth-behrendt and mrs jackson for their word of support in relation to the white paper .
i find that encourage and i look forward to further discussion with them and other member of parliament in relation to the issue that they raise .
mrs ahern raise the issue of liability .
that of course be not specifically address in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putt in place provision - and there be already some - relate to the issue of traceability .
once that be do , issue such as liability can be address .
but i have take on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .
mrs roth-behrendt ask me about establish a positive list .
that be one of the issue that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention be to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list be , as i say , a negative list and it be add to as require .
the establishment of the positive list be one of the issue set out in the annex with a date attach to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed be something that we have identify as a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert be there for food but not for feed .
this be unfortunate and it be wrong , and we believe that it be important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be do .
i hope that the next time you ask me the question , i will be in a position to give you more detail information .
mrs jackson have focus on the fact that there be 24 new and 20 amend piece of legislation and ask whether this compound over-regulation .
i should say that the piece of legislation that we have identify be intend to close gap in existing legislation .
there be a reference to applicant state and that be something that we have in mind .
standard of food safety and indeed other area of safety be obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this be a matter that i have draw to the attention of mr verheugen .
i also welcome the white paper .
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough tooth to prevent something like the beef war that we have have and france be refusal to lift the ban ?
you mention the commission being able to withhold grant and subsidy from country who be acting in the way that france be acting .
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payment for instance , similar to the one that the british farmer be ask for at the moment ?
for example , the work of the eu unit locate in dublin have show that physical distance be no barrier these day to communication and have a effective influence on matter .
all this will be manage with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .
i would ask you on what you base your idea for a location ?
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the white paper that we have not be specific about the makeup of that board .
this be a issue which i expect will be discuss between parliament and the commission over the next few week and month .
i envisage that the board be membership will be made up from stakeholder or representative of stakeholder .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .
we have not do that yet but it will be do in september .
i do not expect that the board will have any function in direct the scientist how to do their work .
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have a overall remit , particularly , for instance , in request the authority to investigate particular area require research .
mr florenz ask whether parliament will have a say in that .
that be a issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of view on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or member of parliament - or indeed parliament nominee - to be member of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominee or even mep themselves , be able to have a opportunity to discuss what issue should be investigate .
it be a issue for consideration but it have not be rule out .
mr florenz also raise the question of anonymity .
i be happy that he raise it because it be particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible .
it must be know .
consumer in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstance and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncement from the authority .
it be fundamentally essential therefore that the authority be not anonymous .
it must be visible .
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
mrs lynne ask whether the authority will have sufficient tooth .
i suspect that the question be focus on the issue of where the competence of the authority begin and end and where the competence and authority of food safety agency in member state begin and end .
there would have to be a interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it be undesirable to have situation develop whereby scientist working for , or advise , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .
that be a undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there be a number of thing that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information be one .
but information which include a fundamental disagreement between scientist on core issue relate to food safety be also a issue of serious concern .
this situation can be achieve over a period of time .
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
it be something that be earn over a period of time .
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinion of the authority on scientific matter be enforce by way of passing legislation which be the function of the commission , parliament and council .
i realise that this be a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arise out of the opinion of the authority be - i believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation be a matter that can be dealt with in the court in the normal way .
one of the issue that we may have to address over time be the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a fast response from the court process .
in relation to grant and subsidy : yes , consideration have be give to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal service and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to mrs lynne be question on interim payment : that be a matter that might very well be address by parliament as it relate to budget issue .
mrs myller then ask me about the location of the authority .
no decision have be take in relation to that other than to say that it be more likely that the authority will be locate centrally rather than on the periphery .
i recognise that the feo be locate in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it be not the centre of europe !
but the fvo be in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .
the fvo be made up of independent scientist and vet and so on who travel from some location where there be a airport - quite clearly we have a airport in dublin .
the food safety authority be situation be quite different .
it have to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientist involve in the food safety authority and those of us who be involve in the initiation of legislation .
equally , the scientist will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-draft process , to ensure that the legislation meet the ill that they have identify .
it seem to me desirable for a authority of this type to be centrally locate .
that be my judgement at the moment .
colleague , i be in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political group and raise it in the conference of president .
if you feel that these session after a commission statement be important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that be allocate to them .
on this occasion we have have six minute of question from the floor of the house and we have have 29 minute of response by the commissioner , and his statement .
as you can see , half-an-hour be not really anything like enough time for such a session .
i hope you might discuss this in your political group so that we can have a better structure session with the commission on such future occasion .
that conclude the debate .
question time ( commission )
that be the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact be that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first part
question no 28 by ( h-0781 / 99 ) :
mr verheugen have the floor on behalf of the commission .
the commission be following with interest the plan construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognis the importance of ensure that the construction of the new plant follow the high internationally accept nuclear safety standard .
accord to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder have not be take yet .
the commission do not have a mandate to impose any limit on decision take by any country in term of energy production , including the nuclear option .
in particular , the commission be aware of the public concern about the record seismic activity in the area of the ecemi fault line locate in the vicinity of the propose plant site .
large design margin be being provide in order to ensure safe operation of the plant accord to the environmental condition of the site .
the commission be also aware of concern about the possible intention of use the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
it acknowledge the fact that turkey have sign and ratify the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapon and have subsequently conclude a comprehensive safeguard agreement with the international atomic energy agency .
thank you for your reply .
i should like to make the following point : turkey be now a candidate country .
this plan be design to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wish to acquire cadou type reactor from canada , which we now know have already be use for nuclear weapon in pakistan and india .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect .
the safety factor in this type of project , and i be speak as a engineer , have nothing to do with increasing safety level in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in case such as this , where there be uncertainty , simulator be use .
however , we cannot use simulator in case relate to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high seismic risk area must be exclude a priori for nuclear installation such as this .
a couple of week ago we have a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate country .
i have explain the position of the commission .
you have to accept the fact that there be no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we do be use political mean to convince some candidate country that we have to have decommission plan for some reactor that be consider not to be upgradable .
in the case of turkey it be different .
the plant be not yet there. i have already said that turkey be part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there be concern about safety we will discuss it with turkey .
if the conclusion be that turkey be planning to build a nuclear power plant that do not meet normal european safety standard be concern then we would do the same as we do with lithuania , slovakia and bulgaria .
i think it be the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concern and fear .
i do not have these concern .
question no 29 by ( h-0786 / 99 ) :
subject : deplete uranium weapon have the commission conduct any study of the potential effect upon eu state of transboundary pollution arise from the use of deplete uranium weapon in the kosovan conflict ?
if not , why not ?
mrs wallström have the floor on behalf of the commission .
thank you , mr bowe , for your question .
the european commission have monitor the environmental effect of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .
as early as last june the commission finance a first study .
it be carry out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and conclude that there have be no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis have overturn that original assessment .
the commission have also be closely associate with the production of the recent report publish by the unite nation environment programme - balkan task force .
this be the most detail and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effect of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet study it .
the use of deplete uranium weapon be one of the many issue consider and this report be now widely available also on the net .
the balkan task force be hamper by the fact that little or no information be available on the actual use of these weapon during the conflict .
no indication of contamination be found in kosovo during the btf fact-finding mission .
however , this do not exclude the possibility that area in kosovo be contaminate by deplete uranium .
from a desk assessment couple with a fact-finding mission the report conclude that the risk , if any , be limit to a area around the target .
future action will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern europe .
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan be also being develop .
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combate war damage if such action should be need .
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the commission have give some consideration to this problem and i be please that these report which have be produce so far have look carefully at the issue .
but i would like to point out that the concern with deplete uranium weapon be about the way in which they be use .
this uranium become air-borne , be inhale and could now be effectively carry by member of the population in kosovo with rather more long-term effect than it have be possible to establish so far .
this seem to be the pattern of event that have emerge after the use of deplete uranium weapon in the gulf war .
how long will you continue to monitor the effect of these weapon ?
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there be still no confirmation that deplete uranium be use in the conflict and no deplete uranium have be detect in the clean-up of kosovo .
but those symptom and those problem that you mention could be there and that could be the effect of the use of deplete uranium .
that be also mention in the report .
no transboundary effect have be detect and most of the weapon will have be use on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .
the problem be that the current political isolation of the country mean that access to this area be restrict .
a big responsibility rest with the unite nation because they be address with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
it also have a long-term effect on thinking when it come to the use of these sort of weapon .
mr president , commissioner , in a few month have time , hundred of thousand of holidaymaker will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from media report that bomb and weapon be dump just off the coast .
be you able to confirm that holidaymaker will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and be there any measure in the pipeline for ascertain what the danger might be in this respect ?
i wish i could give guarantee for many thing but unfortunately i be not able to .
we make our judgement from report like this and the mission we send to check on thing like this .
that be what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have see be that war affect the environment in the long term and be dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just pass a directive on marine pollution .
that also include bullet and weapon and so on and it be a early warning system .
unfortunately we be not able to give guarantee and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
i cannot answer that question .
when it come to medical check and so on , i do not have all the information need to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side be what i have already mention , that there be now a environmental reconstruction plan , but when it come to medical check-up i do not have the information about that .
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question no 30 by ( h-0793 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile receive over 4000 tibetan who escape over the himalayan mountain seek freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
many of the refugee have be severely frost-bitten and many have die along the way .
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?
mr patten have the floor on behalf of the commission .
the concern express by the european parliament about tibet be widely share .
i have long believe in the need to set out our view on human right issue , including tibet , firmly and candidly to the chinese authority .
the european union do that at the european union ­ china summit in pek last month where we press the chinese on a number of human right issue , including tibet .
we again urge the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .
i urge the chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authority .
the appointment of a eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , i be not sure that it would add much practical value to our effort .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authority and we already have effective channel of communication with the tibetan community in exile .
i be also keen to guard against a exponential growth in the number of special envoy , however worthy the cause .
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young woman and so on and so forth , be definitely issue that we could discuss ad infinitum .
if we cut down here and say that the council now share responsibility for this , then i fear that these human right issue will not be give the attention they deserve .
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position be .
i state nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoy be a matter for the council .
as it happen , we deal with the budgetary consequence , the council make the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be look at in due course .
i have long believe that we should all recognise that country where it be best to do business be country that treat their own citizen most decently - everywhere in the world .
i repeat that we have made our position know to the chinese on tibet .
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan greeting , which betoken peace and happiness .
the question before us now be what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness , the dalai lama have s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member have said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition .
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .
it be a extremely moving account , not just of his responsibility in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual view as well .
the commission , like others , have urge dialogue .
the dalai lama have made it clear that peaceful dialogue be what he wish .
i wish that the chinese authority have respond consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .
at or around the time of president clinton be visit to china , the president of the people be republic of china give the impression that dialogue be on the agenda .
question no 31 by ( h-0795 / 99 ) :
be these report accurate ?
what be the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its word and its action on the reform of eu administration ?
mr patten have the floor on behalf of the commission .
the newspaper report that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
in november 1999 the commission approve at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporate into its rule of procedure .
at the moment the commission be consult its staff representative on the document , a process which will be finalise in the forthcoming week .
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be note that the new commission give a immediate follow-up to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry relate to the code .
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the draft of the code , it have take on board all the draft recommendation of the european ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively deal with the relation of the commission be administration with the public .
it will be adopt through a legally-binding commission decision to be publish in the official journal of the european community .
the document have be draw up taking full account of the provision contain in the draft prepare by the european ombudsman be office .
accord to the relate provision in the treaty the responsible legislator for establish its rule of procedure be the commission itself .
however , it go without saying that the commission adhere to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspect of administrative reform .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it have be on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper report be misleading .
i do not think there be any difference between us and the ombudsman .
there be a question about the legislative base on which we have take the best advice and i think we be soundly place on that .
i want to repeat that honourable member , like the honourable member who ask the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it be extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .
be it true that the content of all part of the proposal will be approve ?
let me read what it say in my brief - and as it be in my brief it must be true !
" i would like to stress again that the commission have accept all the ombudsman be recommendation contain in his draft recommendation of july 1999 " .
both document , that be the commission be document and the ombudsman be draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that have arise be the legislative basis .
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there be no doubt that we be on all four with the ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten have s note into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the member to bear in mind .
as the author be not present , question no 32 lapse .
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. i be sorry .
accord to the rule of procedure , you be not require to reply .
i wish you a good evening .
second part
question to mr nielson , who be replace by mr patten
question 33 and 34 of question to the commission be intend for mr nielson .
mr nielson cannot be present today since he be in south africa .
question no 33 by ( h-0829 / 99 ) :
subject : have mainstream have in eu aid policy in 1995 the council draw up guideline for integrate the equal opportunity dimension ( have mainstream have ) into the full range of eu aid policy .
have mainstream have mean taking account of equality between woman and man as a integral part of all form of development policy , strategy and measure .
to achieve that , the council be guideline must be implement in their entirety .
current staff must receive compulsory train in equal opportunity and 1-2 day have train in such issue should form a essential part of the directorate-general for development be introductory course for new staff .
be the commission prepare to take such measure ?
the train of staff moving to the delegation in the different region be another entry point .
the train then would be automatically perform without being compulsory .
we also aim to include train in these issue in the basic train that our official receive in project cycle management .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of train automatically built into programme at the outset , instead of have to be tackle separately and later .
my own view as a former development minister be that these issue should be mainstream themselves and tackle at the heart of train and not turn into a sort of optional add-on .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate-general for development at all level .
it be not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goal and strategy , together with a transformation of institution and process so that both woman have s and man have s priority and need be better reflect .
in addition , measure must be take to combat difference on the ground of gender .
equality must permeate not only project and programme but also all overarch goal , action plan and strategy .
it would appear that we be in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensure that due attention be give to equality lie with departmental and unit manager .
if the latter do not have the require professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstream will no longer be a priority .
extremely few member of the directorate-general for development , that be to say unit manager and more senior manager , have take part in the gender course that have be organise .
only one manager have participate in gender train , and for half a day .
that be naturally unacceptable .
what be the commission prepare to do to ensure that unit manager and more senior manager go through the necessary gender train ?
gender have in fact be include in the compulsory introductory course for new employee , but then with only one to two hour devote to it on each course .
this limit train element have , however , be remove from all introductory course which have take place in recent time .
as i point out in my question , one to two day , and not one to two hour , need to be devote to the subject .
my question be this : be the commission really prepare to comply with the adopt guideline for gender mainstream at the directorate-general for development ?
well i certainly take gender mainstream seriously and so do my colleague commissioner nielson .
and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they have adequate gender train .
that go for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
it be not something which more senior official can deem appropriate for their junior but think that they be too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member have said .
i hope the approach that we be following both demonstrate practicality and the imperative of give this the attention which it deserve .
question no 34 by ( h-0831 / 99 ) :
subject : aid for central asia what development aid and what humanitarian aid do the commission grant to the country of central asia , and what be its assessment of the impact of this aid ?
question to mrs diamantopoulou
since 1991 , the community have provide significant financial support to the new independent state including the country of central asia .
the major part of european union aid have be provide under the tacis programme .
in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan receive technical assistance of eur 75 million .
this assistance have deliver benefit in all sector , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthen of institution .
security consideration have prevent tajikistan from benefit fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7.2 million have be in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programme , the european union have support important regional action in the energy , transport and environmental sector .
food security programme in central asia begin in 1996 , following two previous year when the european union provide food aid in kind .
these programme have benefit kyrgyzstan and to a more limit extent , tajikistan .
fund for ngo programme in tajikistan amount to eur 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , kyrgyzstan receive eur 17 million .
since 1993 the commission be european community humanitarian office , echo , have be active in support the most vulnerable group and sector in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3.8 million be grant to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan receive over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supply , water and sanitation .
frequent monitor and situation assessment have show that european union assistance be contribute to the stability of these country and therefore the ongoing peace process .
mr president , commissioner , there be a risk of central asia and the caspian sea becoming the balkans of the 21st century .
that be why it be imperative to stabilise the two major state of turkmenistan and uzbekistan in particular .
we be able , at the istanbul summit a couple of week ago , to meet and have discussion with some of the central asian republic .
i be very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
i can send the honourable member , if he would like , a detail breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreement with each of the central asian republic .
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future be on the gloomy side .
but i have no doubt at all that he be right to point to the strategic importance of central asia. i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well .
so the honourable member be remark about the strategic importance of these region be extremely well made .
we be contribute to programme in the region which have some ecological impact .
our food programme be directly relate to structural reform in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation .
those programme themselves be intend to ensure that agriculture have a more soundly base position in those society and do not consist simply of raping the land .
there be a ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
we also take good note of the fact that the member who have ask the question have applaud the commissioner have s answer .
this be not the usual state of affair .
and furthermore the commissioner have not quote from his bibliography this time .
thank you very much , mr patten , for your intervention today .
question no 35 by ( h-0778 / 99 ) :
could the commission say whether the greek government have made any specific commitment on how to tackle the problem of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitment be ?
have the government legislate for and put into place a suitable system for pinpoint , recording and monitor fluctuation in unemployment , or be most of the measure perhaps still limit to count those out of work ?
as far as mr papayannaki have question be concern , in the 1999 action plan for employment , the commission propose certain recommendation for greece with a view to improve the efficiency of the action plan for employment .
the greek government introduce two specific programme in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " yes to work " and " back to work " .
we do not yet have the final result of these programme and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objective be achieve .
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honour the commitment which it have made .
thank you , commissioner for your reply .
you tell me that you , as the commission , have made recommendation .
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendation will be adhere to .
however , my question for a very long time have be this : what happen with previous policy ?
do anyone find work ?
how many people found work ?
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
what have be do about train ?
be the purpose of the famous train centre to provide job for instructor or trainee ?
do we have any figure ?
in other word , do we have way of check what be happening with this government policy in greece ?
greece have see a increase in the employment rate and , as far as i can see , a increase in productivity .
the action which the commission can take relate to the specific guideline .
as you know , there be 22 guideline on which each country be evaluate .
they concern access to train , the ratio of man to woman with access to train , and special action for the long-term unemployed .
the commission will endeavour , for all these specific guideline , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information base on the implementation of the new community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
question no 36 by ( h-0782 / 99 ) :
the danish pension scheme , the efterløn , only allow people resident in denmark and people who have complete the require period of employment in denmark to retire .
some worker have complain to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire .
the danish authority do not consider that they be oblige under community law to pay this compensation to worker taking early retirement who do not meet the condition require under danish law .
the commission service set up a procedure for joint meeting and discussion with the danish government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
the last meeting on the subject be held in november 1999 and we be wait for the commission service have final proposal on whether or not infringement proceedings will be institute against denmark .
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme have not be approve by the commission .
i should like to ask the commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadline in connection with this matter , for it be a problem which need clarification in the context of the danish socio-political debate .
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
honourable member , i should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other member state be have problem interpreting the directive and transpose them into national law .
i think that the answer be brief and clear .
of course it be as you say .
there will be no problem with danish national within denmark , that be not where the problem lie .
the problem be with danish national or other national reside outside denmark .
question no 37 by ( h-0791 / 99 ) :
a proposal have be draft for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctor .
the content of the proposal concern the average 48-hour working week of doctor , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hour .
the council , commission and parliament be all agree on the content but there be disagreement on the transitional period for implement the directive .
parliament have propose 4 year , the commission 7 and the council 13 .
this proposal be still being discuss by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
question no 38 by ( h-0805 / 99 ) :
which commissioner be member of this group ?
how many meeting of the group have be held to date ?
what concrete measure have be discuss ?
this question cover several individual matter .
it refer to the special commission working group deal with question of equality .
the commissioner taking part be president prodi , vice-president kinnock , mr red and myself .
the meeting of the working group be open and the first meeting be held on 11 january 2000 .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your reply , although i regret the fact that this working group have take so long to meet , since this matter be of the great importance .
we trust this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issue relate to great equality for man and woman .
mrs avilés-perea , that be a exhortation rather than a question .
but if the commissioner wish to offer doctrine or good intention ...
allow me to say just one word. i agree that the working group should have met early but at least , once it do , important decision be take straight away .
question no 39 by ( h-0807 / 99 ) :
under this umbrella , each member state be to submit proposal in the form of a community initiative programme for that particular country .
what criterion will the commission use to approve or reject the member state have programme ?
which community body will control the fund of the steering group and the monitor committee and verify that the programme be carry out exactly and correctly ?
the european social fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. as the equal initiative be a joint fund venture with the member state , what will greece be contribution amount to ?
the equal initiative be not restrict to certain group of people .
its purpose be to combat discrimination in the workplace .
the decision on this initiative be take in berlin , where it be decide to take account of professional group of asylum seeker and to include them in its action .
this be a important aspect of this initiative .
the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with the regulation .
this be the same as the social fund regulation , i.e. equal come under the social fund regulation .
it have be submit to parliament and we expect parliament have s opinion next month .
i should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfy national requirement and national plan define in accordance with agree european strategy .
the member state , i.e. the national government , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agency , submit proposal , select the proposal which the programme will implement and carry out primary control .
within the european commission , the directorate-general for employment be responsible for implementation , while financial control be the responsibility of the directorate-general for financial control , the anti-fraud office and the european court of auditor .
the last question concern the amount grant .
mr president , i feel that the guideline for the community equal initiative , especially the four action describe in it , will result both in complicate bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure .
for example , one wonder how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as require by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guideline .
however , this contradict the state aim of the general objective for decentralise action plan at the level of local authority and rural area .
however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminate against , such as asylum seeker , immigrant and so on , be render impossible or merely symbolic .
secondly , i have to say that the aim of the equal initiative be not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reduce unemployment , or to support a increase in employment .
that be the job of the european strategy for employment and the social fund , which have huge sum of money and exceptionally large resource at their disposal , especially for country like greece .
question no 40 by ( h-0808 / 99 ) :
subject : article 13 teu and employment the draft commission directive establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation give exemption to religious organisation ( art . 4.2 ) .
could the commission please tell parliament the circumstance and the group within article 13 ( teu ) likely to be effect by such a exemption ?
a month ago , the commission submit a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribe in the treaty , in order to implement article 13 .
the ban on discrimination be the rule in the package of directive and programme which we submit .
at the commission have s proposal and after approximately two year of consultation with social agency , member state and the european parliament , a number of exception have be made .
these exception relate to profession which must be exercise by person with a genuine professional qualification .
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
in a religious school , it be logical for a exemption to be request and accept in order to ensure that the teacher be of the faith to which the religious school in question belong .
that be the sort of exemption we be talk about .
clearly this be not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member state to introduce special provision be only justify in the case of this special professional qualification .
this be a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .
for instance , religious school could quite properly say to a roman catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you be a gay man or because you be a lesbian .
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
it allow a choice to be made only where special qualification be need which relate directly to the activity in question .
in other word , it be positive discrimination .
in the example which you mention , it be only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic .
that be the only form of exemption which be acceptable .
question no 41 by ( h-0813 / 99 ) :
do the commission intend to put forward low common denominator policy which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these woman , or will their plight once again be overlook by the new employment policy ?
obviously , the cohesion policy exist for less-favoured region and cooperation and joint action by the structural fund , the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy .
i should point out that the fund available for region with problem account for one third of the total budget .
i should point out that 70 % of fund for the period 2000-2006 , i.e. eur 195 billion , will go to the less-favoured region of europe .
commissioner , thank you for give me a well-intentioned answer , which have be rigorous and well-argue .
however , i can assure you that we do not , with the existing measure - which you have refer to - reach these severely less-favoured region .
they be area where there be much need and we have to put them on a equal footing with those area where we work in cooperation , where almost none exist .
i be very familiar with the programme which you refer to .
i can assure you that we be not reach the area where there be most need .
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of apply microcredit policy .
the commissioner accept and take good note of mrs izquierdo rojo have s intervention .
question no 42 by ( h-0817 / 99 ) :
can the commission say what its precise intention be regard the presentation of a new social action programme ?
we estimate that the commission have s new social action programme for the next five year will be ready at the end of this summer .
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultation with parliament , the social partner and non-governmental organisation .
these discussion have already start , but we will need to take account of the result in lisbon .
the lisbon european council be trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reform .
these result will be most important in shape the commission have s social programme .
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of development , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
we need to see which concrete alternative the commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiative it will take for the purpose of reach agreement .
firstly , i agree with you entirely .
account will be take of the information society ; that be something which i too mention .
social exclusion , the programme for woman , the effort we be making in the social protection area , everything need to be look at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
secondly , there will obviously be timetable for the initiative within which systematic monitor will also have to be implement .
since the author be not present , question no 43 lapse .
question no 44 by ( h-0819 / 99 ) :
however , for people with various kind of physical disability who be in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement be still highly restrict .
what measure be the commission taking to facilitate opportunity for the disable in this area ?
on 26 november 1999 , the european commission approve a package of measure to combat discrimination .
as far as the package in question and people with special need be concern , there be a directive which concentrate on combate discrimination , especially in the workplace .
the european commission believe that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special need and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these person .
of course , it be particularly important for people with special need to have access to mean of transport , service and all type of installation if they be to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
the european commission have approve a proposal for a directive on special arrangement in buse , coach and other vehicle , so that people with special need with mobility problem and people use wheelchair have access to them .
i would thank the commissioner for her answer .
my question in the first place concern the opportunity the disable have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .
i be grateful for the fact that the commission have adopt a action plan .
it be of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resource and mean of actually crossing the border physically if you have a disability .
i refer to the directive which the commission have propose on compulsory arrangement for mean of public transport , so that people with special need can use them .
it have not yet be pass by the council ; it be at the consultation stage .
i think that a strategic decision of this sort can be take at european level .
i think it be exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programme for personal transport .
that be dealt with either under special programme in education , for young people , for woman and for exchange or must be a matter for national policy .
question no 45 by ( h-0006 / 00 ) :
subject : compliance with directive 96 / 71 / ec concerning the post of worker the post of worker directive have still not be implement in denmark , even though the deadline have pass .
the draft legislation before the folket do not contain any rule governing right of employ person under collective agreement .
however , such use of a agreement outside its specific scope cannot be impose on the two side of industry without a legal basis .
there be therefore two possible solution : either the directive be inapplicable in denmark , or denmark be require by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreement .
if not , will it explain how the directive be to be comply with in this area ?
the european union post of worker directive stipulate that the compulsory rule concerning the term and condition of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to worker post to that country .
what it say it that one of two thing may apply , i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreement which have be declare to be the rule universally applicable to a specific sector .
in other word , to put it simply , denmark have a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
discussion be being held between the european commission and denmark , and denmark be expect to notify the commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .
the deadline by which it have to answer the commission have s question expire on 6 december 1999 and we have not receive a reply .
we be wait to see what the next move will be .
firstly , no attempt be being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country .
as i said early , there be always problem interpreting the directive of the european commission both because they have a very general framework and because system be very different from one country to another .
as far as your question be concern , this problem do not only apply to denmark .
it be not only denmark which have matter pending .
five country have transpose this into national legislation and the rest be at the discussion stage .
and this be the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine government to move .
thank you very much , commissioner , for your dedication .
you have fulfill your objective for today , which be to answer all the question .
we congratulate you .
since the time allocate to question to the commission have elapse , question 46 to 68 will be reply to in writing .
that conclude question time .
( the sitting be suspend at 7.50 p.m. and resume at 9.00 p.m. )
1997 discharge
the commissioner , mrs schrey , be not here yet , but i hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minute .
mr president , i be sure that mrs schrey must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .
i would like to start by thank my colleague for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it be today without that spirit of cooperation .
mr president , early last year , the 1997 discharge be postpone because this parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resign commission which could not enter into any commitment for the future .
in its resolution , this parliament state that discharge could not be grant until we have receive serious , far-reaching proposal for reform from the new european commission .
this report , therefore , appear at a crucial time , on the eve of mr kinnock have s reform .
it be a excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce far-reaching reform to these plan .
in the period leading up to this , it already appear , on the basis of the initial draft , that the commission have made very important pledge .
we ask for a whistle-blower have s regulation , and this be now in place .
parliament want financial inspection and audit function to be separate .
this have now be do .
parliament require a code of conduct for commissioner and cabinet .
this be in place too .
parliament ask the commission to waive its excessive privilege .
it do this as well .
the commission have also enter into commitment to cooperate with parliament in term of sem 2000 .
fundamental change will also be consider for the technical assistance office .
these be sound , first step which illustrate that , if this parliament so wish , change be not only possible but can also be translate into action quickly .
we want more than that , however .
the commission should now produce a ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
this be not only necessary for proper public administration , it be a conditio sine qua non of regain the trust of the european citizen .
we now demand from the european commission clear pledge concerning the following point .
firstly , parliament must have complete access to all commission document .
this , however , presuppose that we set up a internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive document .
in the context of providing information , i would like to draw the commission have s attention to the fact that we be very concern about the present draft plan on public access to document .
if the current draft be correct , then this be a huge step backwards in comparison to today .
we must put a end to the situation in which financially powerful organisation with representation in brussels be able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen be not .
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body hold the copyright to public document .
we would also like a clear job description for each european official so that a official with conscientious objection can more easily object to task which be unethical or unlawful .
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the european court of auditor and its national counterpart .
this parliament have also ask the commission to give a initial outline of the external aid policy reform on 31 march of this year .
i would quote gaza as a example .
it be unacceptable that the commission complete the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it have be left unused .
mr president , since 1996 , the discharge have acquire a heavy , political significance .
it be one of the most powerful weapon parliament have and must therefore be deploy with care .
this be why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
however , we be not surrender this weapon without place a time bomb in its place .
indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be give until all financial irregularity highlight by the court of auditor have be clear up .
finally , this discharge report be naturally address to the commission .
but this do not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order .
as long as we have no status , we be not credible as a force for reform the union .
the reform of the european institution be necessary in order to be able to continue europe have s development process .
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it be also open and democratic .
all institution must now join force in order to work together towards building this type of europe .
mr president , the committee on industry decide to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we be not specifically ask to do so .
during the course of our work on this report it become clear that there be persistent problem in the spend area under the control of our budget .
they be not unique to 1997 and two strand seem to run through them .
the first be a tendency for the commission to embark on very ambitious programme , particularly in third country , without sufficient assessment of the practicality of implementation and proper resource .
the second involve serious managerial shortcoming in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across department and management of external contract .
i know that all the institution bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the commission and for some of the lack of resource .
that cannot excuse everything that we come across .
citizen of europe expect the european institution to be properly manage and they be right to do so .
that be why i want to echo the comment from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which have be promise to the people of europe by mr prodi and mr kinnock .
from what i have see of the reform process , it look good .
i saw some of mr kinnock be paper today , i heard some of what he have to say .
i have every confidence that if we and the politician of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
but we need that reform process .
many of the general point raise in our committee be report have be cover in mrs van der laan be report .
it be a excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
it seem to hit on all the right point without just being like some of the old report , a series of detail .
it group them together and that be very important .
there be two issue i would like to draw your attention to .
one be nuclear safety in eastern europe .
we have to get this right .
the committee of independent expert said the commission be not managing this properly .
we have to remedy that .
the second point be about scrutiny mechanism .
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spend .
we need proper information , give in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .
it have be see as a bureaucratic process to be do as quickly as possible in as little time as possible .
i hope colleague in this house will support the ground for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the commission will push ahead with the reform process which be long overdue .
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restore .
the socialist group will be vote to grant discharge .
i be sure you will be relieve to hear that as well .
but that be not to say that we be satisfy , and that everything in the garden be rosy .
it be clear that a radical overhaul of the commission be long overdue .
it indicate , however , that we acknowledge that step be being made in the right direction .
i just want to outline some of the issue that we , as socialist , have put down as amendment .
we hope these will be carry because they be important in the way that they will impact on future reform .
first of all , the immunity of official : this should be lift if and when request by a national prosecutor .
we need to make it much easy to prosecute official who be guilty of fraud and corruption .
it be critical to note that the commission have too often fail to act on the reform recommend by the court of auditor .
the court be report be there for a reason , our response to it be there for a reason and it be important that it be follow through .
i have just heard now that a audit progress board be going to be set up by the commission .
even if we hear nothing else , we know that be going in the right direction in term of the reform that we want to see .
too often we have put forward recommendation and they have not be act upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .
we want to see that follow-through to a much great extent in future .
the other issue be access to confidential document .
we have have problem in the past in term of our responsibility in carry out discharge because we have not have access to the document we should have have .
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we be give document we must ensure that confidential document will indeed be kept confidential .
we have put down a amendment to that effect .
one issue which be refer to in the van der laan report be the whole question of the gaza hospital .
the situation there be totally unacceptable .
we will not put up with it for much longer and we be look for immediate action on that issue .
i would like to congratulate lousewy van der laan .
i do not usually bother congratulate people but i think she have produce a very cogent report and deserve our thanks .
mr president , commissioner , if we be honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .
we be discuss last year have s discharge , but also the commission have s responsibility .
i would like to raise the problem which be still pile up high on our desk .
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be grant also depend to some extent on where the emphasis be place .
it be about a commission which be no more .
there be now a new commission .
then it be logical to grant discharge , because how can the current commissioner be blame where 1997 be concern ?
the problem remain and this give rise to doubt .
we have to take a decision now regard the commission have s good intention , but there be still no structural outline for these good intention .
mr kinnock will present his proposal next month .
we be all very much anticipate this , but the fact be still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .
it be clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur have also struggle .
this dilemma stretch beyond the area which i have already list .
take , for example , the pledge made by the commission .
they look good in themselves .
i have read a few document write by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
but i will give two example from which it be not as evident that the good intention which the commission have now express will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of document .
the previous speaker already said something about this .
a document be circulate at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the commission - which , instead of enhance the public nature of document , be have the opposite effect .
this be a illustration of empty pledge not necessarily leading to good result .
this also apply to whistle-blower .
we have still not have a response to crucial question of this type .
so there be doubt as to whether these pledge of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decision need to be made .
this also apply , for example , to the very real project which the committee on industry have introduce .
clear progress must be visible .
at present , we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposal , but it be not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .
finally , mr president , the 1996 discharge be the beginning of the end of the last commission .
in assess the question of whether or not to grant the commission discharge , the decision must be base upon what actually occur during the financial year concern , in this case in the course of 1997 .
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 be in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
in that year , we vote against grant discharge .
as a result , we shall vote against grant discharge for 1997 , too .
we think that this picture of ours be confirm by the examination carry out by the court of auditor .
it be both good and necessary that reform have be promise .
so far , the promise which have be made be still , however , to be fulfill , especially where transparency be concern .
we be therefore going to vote in favour of the demand for reform which be present in the resolution , but against the grant of discharge .
mr president , first of all , i have only positive comment to make on mrs van der laan have s very expert work on this report .
the union for a europe of nation group cannot vote for approve the account for 1997 .
the report on so-called discharge contain a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the account .
we support these critical remark , and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approve the account .
again , i must say that we be concern here with a extremely unfortunate confusion of the old commission have s accountability for 1997 and the new commission have s accountability for the future .
we do not think that the new commission , under any circumstance , could incur liability for the past .
we think it be wrong to talk about the commission have s liability as a institution .
the mistake up until 1999 be attributable to those who have responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new commission can do any better .
by mean of this extraordinary procedure , parliament be stop itself from place liability for the arrangement in 1997 squarely where it belong , namely with the previous commission .
it be the 1996 account which led to the downfall of the previous commission , and the 1997 account be just as incriminate .
there be no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
that be just the way thing be , however .
in taking over the mandate , the new commission have to assume responsibility not just for the achievement of the past but also for the mistake made .
this question ought to have be ask when the new commission be appoint .
if parliament vote in favour of the committee on budgetary control have s proposal this week and grant discharge , then the commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .
for it be the third section of mrs van der laan have s report that be the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .
the comment contain within , under eight heading , be a integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which form the basis of our decision .
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission present its reform programme .
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , be being display vis-à-vis the discharge authority .
mr president , we all recall that parliament decide to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitment from the new european commission regard internal reform .
in response to this the commission have enter into various commitment and have certainly adopt many reform measure .
it be fair to say that the new president , mr prodi , and his team be certainly commit to implement the financial control requirement as laid down by this parliament .
existing eu treaty will be amend so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
i have no doubt further reform of eu institution will be analyse in this debate .
mr president , the commission be now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it do not deserve it .
1997 be a matter for the old commission and , therefore , the new commission do not think that it can accept liability .
it be true that implementation of the budget for 1997 fell within the old commission have s remit .
the new commission have , on the other hand , undertake to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandal , and i must admit that i be not impress at all .
the old mindset which involve sweeping thing under the carpet and protect one have s friend unfortunately still exist .
there be some who think that it be more in our interest to let bygone be bygone and make a fresh start .
i do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy thing up properly .
i be refer here especially to the early scandal involve echo .
i be very indignant about the fact that it be so difficult to get any document hand over on this matter .
i be the rapporteur for echo on the committee on budgetary control , and i shall have a lot of difficulty carry out my work if the commission will not give me the necessary information .
from the outside , it look as if the commission have something to hide .
my investigation also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
the commission be not putt all its card on the table and be in that way repeat ancient practice on the part of the commission .
it be this practice which led to the commission have s downfall .
i can therefore fully support the demand to give parliament unconditional right of access to document .
otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .
thank you , commissioner schrey .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
response to second report of committee of independent expert
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent expert chair by mr middelhoek to investigate allegation of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .
on 15 march the committee publish its first report conclude that : " it be becoming difficult to find anyone who have even the slight sense of responsibility " .
within a few hour of the presentation of the report president santer announce the resignation of his entire team .
the resignation mark the end of a bitter struggle between a increasingly confident parliament and a european commission mire in allegation of scandal .
since then the brussels landscape have change beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorate parliament have be elect and a new commission confirm in office .
the new commission have already take important step to move away from the way it use to function .
a code of conduct for commissioner and their private office have be adopt .
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioner have voluntarily renounce their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer good .
new rule have be draw up and implement governing the appointment of senior official .
the number of department have be reduce .
the commission , in my opinion , have show a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they be to be congratulate .
in order to achieve this , action be require in four area .
first , financial management and control within the commission must be improve .
one of the main problem be the lack of a function system of financial control .
the commission be dg must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .
a new independent audit system service must be set up .
dg must publish their own annual account so as to enable a clear identification of problem area and set annual target for reduce fraud and irregularity .
in return for this great degree of autonomy , manager must be made fully and personally responsible for their action .
it be clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
change to the financial regulation will be require and parliament must have its say on those change .
but while the commission must ensure that it respect the treaty and the financial regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be a excuse for inertia .
urgent change be require today .
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthen , firstly by create a culture in which they cannot thrive .
this require a clear example to be set by commissioner and senior staff as well as adequate train and secondly , by reinforce the existing mechanism for deal with fraud .
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , by the middle of this year .
third , standard in european public life must be upheld .
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission early this year clearly demonstrate the need for unambiguous and enforceable rule of conduct .
a number of code have since be introduce .
they must be assess by parliament and should be made legally binding .
whistle-blower who act in good faith must be protect .
at the end of last year mr kinnock announce new measure for the protection of whistle-blower .
they must be implement without delay .
although such measure can never be a alternative for good management , they must be a escape valve when something go wrong .
crucially , reform must not be limit to the commission .
parliament must consider itself the need for improvement to its internal rule , administrative procedure and management practice .
finally , the commission be human resource policy must be modernise .
it be clearly no longer suit to the requirement of a modern , multinational organisation .
the social dialogue have often act as a brake on reform and its overhaul be long overdue .
a career with the european institution must become more attractive .
too many young , new official be leave their job after just a few year .
merit must be recognise and reward , specific skill train should be a sine qua non for promotion to a high grade .
the promotion procedure must be made fair and more transparent .
last but not least the pay and benefit package must be review .
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market condition .
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
this communication must contain a clear timetable .
with a new commission and a new parliament up and running the momentum for reform be now as strong as it ever have be and probably ever will be .
enlargement of the union be just a few year away .
now be the time for europe to put its own house in order ; to instil in its institution - as the independent expert might have said - a sense of responsibility .
in june of last year europe be voter give a clear signal that they be fed up with endless story about mismanagement and nepotism .
there be a very simple way to deal with those story .
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .
all the expert can provide information and news , formulate opinion and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so .
it be just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the european parliament or its committee any documentation .
member of parliament must possess the quality of morality , discipline and discretion over delegate issue innately , and these certainly cannot be impose on them by anyone else .
i would point out that there be no european legal system , but that a different legal system exist in each member state .
we run the risk of delegate issue relate to the same offence which will then be punish in different way .
i be oppose to european community official being accused of criminal act at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing be a method that have no place in the third millennium .
this debate on the van hulten report bring to a close one of the most traumatic period for the european institution since their creation in 1957 .
remember that the council of minister , absent again this evening from our debate , approve the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the commission itself resign on 15 march .
now we come to the second report of the committee of independent expert which we already have the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last september .
our great concern in the epp be to ensure that public confidence in the european commission be restore .
further step to build a strong europe will be to no avail if the european people perceive that there be no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous official .
under no circumstance will we concede ground which we have win over the past few month , which we believe to be in the interest of openness and transparency .
we be therefore concern to see the flurry of commission announcement in recent week by commissioner kinnock suggest policy proposal of various kind to be put in a white paper shortly .
while convey a desire to proceed rapidly , it also give the impression that the commission be in transmission rather than listen mode .
our concern be strengthen if the rumour report a few day ago be true - namely that the commission want to limit severely the access of parliament to information .
this be , after all , one of the cause of the downfall of the last commission .
have the lesson not be learnt ?
the knowledge that the framework relation between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiate led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debate his report in committee .
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demean for parliament to set out detail instruction as to what we want the commission to take up in its reform package .
the less precise , mr van hulten , we be in our resolution , the more room it give the commission and your former colleague in the council to do what they like .
we believe the vast number of recommendation of the wise man have s report should be implement .
look to the future , we know that we be at the beginning of a long process of continue reform in the european commission .
we want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for commission official acknowledge in the outside world - a reputation that have be darken by the inappropriate conduct of a few individual .
commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occur .
in a nutshell : there be programme being run for which there be insufficient staff resource available .
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing need of the commission base on the essential activity for which it be responsible .
our position be made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
we will be vigilant over the next five year to ensure the reform now being suggest be fully implement and will support effort made to modernise institution .
let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheaval by have a ongoing dialogue which assume from the outset that parliament will be a equal partner in decide the outcome of commission reform .
mr president , i must start by apologise that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation .
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report .
it be a excellent report .
it would have be wrong for parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that come from a external body because parliament should have its own opinion on these issue .
it be right for us to have a focus report which be what mr van hulten have produce .
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse .
yes , a lot of thing be lost by the socialist but they have not be win in plenary yet , and may i warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his effort so far .
he have be clear that his commitment have be to produce a radical change .
central to this be the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
it be clear that this need to be develop at all level and it need to recognise the need of each level within the commission .
it be clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation .
that be important .
we need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .
where failure be occur within the commission we need to hold people responsible .
we need to be assure that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
this be natural elsewhere but it seem to be a extremely radical suggestion when it be put to the commission .
we cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud be cost the european taxpayer money and providing them with a poor service .
i will give you one example of this .
in the 1998 court of auditor report a exchange rate miscalculation in relation to italian wine cost the taxpayer of europe gbp 8 to 10 million .
it be clear that be not acceptable .
what happen to the person who be responsible for that miscalculation ?
we need a system which provide incentive and promotion and we need to see this promotion base on merit .
we recognise that most of the official within the commission be extremely hard-working .
but we also recognise that some of the practice be outdated .
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouse should not throw stone .
the european parliament have not exactly be clean in its approach to thing throughout its history .
we have a long way to go before we be perfect ourselves .
our own staff policy be outdated .
some of our working practice need radical reform .
i hope that the european parliament will be hanging onto the coattail of the commission in this reform process .
we recognise the proposal on activity-based budget .
we recognise that mean discipline on the part of commission official and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priority .
finally , can i say that the commission need to work on its relationship with the public .
european taxpayer need to be re-assured .
the fate of the commission , of the whole european union , rest on delivery of this reform .
that be the key issue , delivery of these proposal .
mr president , i would like to start by extend my compliment to the rapporteur , mr van hulten , on his first report .
i very much admire him for keeping his spirit up at a time when he be inundate with so many amendment .
we have submit a amendment to this effect .
from the many point made by mr van hulten in his report , i would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly .
firstly , i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of document .
the commission have s record leave a great deal to be desire .
we notice this when we have to investigate the flechard affair , which , as it happen , have still not be sort out .
curiously , very important document have go missing from the cabinet , even from those of the president and of various directorates-general , and this be clearly something which should not happen .
if parliament want to carry out proper inspection , these document must be available , and i would like to know what the commission intend to do to improve this situation .
i would also like to say a few word about ex post financial control .
this have also be partly dealt with in the van hulten report .
i think it would be useful if we be to give report figure per category and per sector on how the budget be implement .
the general impression at present be that anything budget-related within europe be bad .
it be clear that , over the past couple of year , we have notice a upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .
be this possible ?
i would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reform have to be carry out .
if we admit new member state then we need to put our own house in order first .
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten .
it be his first report here in plenary .
this be worth a compliment although i regret , of course , that he do not expound it in his own mother tongue .
it be a report which come about with difficulty and may well be too late .
in my opinion , this be mainly down to the wrangle between the two major group within our committee on budgetary control .
let us be honest .
the second report of the wise man arrive in september .
we be now four month down the line .
meanwhile , mr van hulten have be inundate with amendment , more than 100 amendment in the first round .
he go back to work , rewrite his report and take into account the very many suggestion , but have to face nearly another 100 amendment in the second round .
my fear be that all of this have contribute to a report which be too detail , too extensive and too late .
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
mr van hulten , my group of the green and regionalist will support the attempt in tomorrow afternoon have s plenary meeting to embellish this report .
after all , it make no sense to copy the many sound recommendation made by the committee of wise man word for word in your report .
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendment or against specific paragraph , this be certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable .
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully back the recommendation made by the committee of wise man .
in any event , i look forward to the document which be approve by the commission today .
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february .
i think that there be a need for this , as public opinion be look for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .
mr president , this report be positive but , actually , we need more than this .
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .
they be most likely to occur if there be little democratic control on cash flow .
via the structural fund , a great deal of the european budget be being pump around the system .
this be only useful as long as there be a sense of solidarity where rich member state contribute to both the revenue and development of poor member state .
but there be also fund which be being pump via brussels back to the same rich member state .
district and regional authority consider this as their own money but they can only get their hand on this by invest vast amount of money and manpower in lobby and negotiate .
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for strict control be more pronounce .
even the strict control cannot solve this problem .
it will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involve in choose and develop project .
it would be preferable if national government channel this money directly to their local government without a european detour .
this be probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less overhead , more transparency and more democracy .
mr president , a year have not yet pass , but it be already clear that parliament be going to evaluate the first and second report differently .
trade union representative sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulation committee , thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal official and preserve the staff regulation in their fossilise state .
i therefore understand why we be meeting at this time , which be usually set aside for other activity and not for debate , discussion and the exchange of information .
mr president , when it come to putt its own house in order , the european commission be in a catch-22 situation .
there be enormous pressure of expectation following the event that led to the resignation of the previous commission .
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposal made here in this chamber sound , the more applause they receive .
this may explain why we experience more difficulty than anticipate in the committee on budgetary control as regard this issue .
nevertheless , the outcome be now on the table and there for all to see , and i would expressly like to thank mr van hulten for the work he have do on this report .
provide this report be not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendment , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demand of the commission on a number of crucial point .
allow me to start with the most important demand .
we do not want financial control to be abolish .
the commission be send out the wrong signal here , by rename the directorate-general for financial control as the directorate-general for audit , for example .
it may well be easy enough to change the commission have s organisation chart but it be a different matter when it come to the legal text , particularly those relate to budgetary discipline .
this cannot be ignore or evade , certainly not on account of soft law , as be once suggest at a meeting of our committee .
it be to be welcome that mr van hulten have s report make the connection between all three area and also make it clear as to where the crucial shortcoming lie , which must be tackle .
a few salient point : the disciplinary procedure be not taking effect , especially when it come to calling official to account for their misdemeanour , including those of a financial nature .
there be a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanction be concern , and it be precisely in this area that the announcement made by the commission be rather vague .
i can only emphasise that these be the really hard nuts that finally need to be crack .
mr president , firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulation to my colleague , mr van hulten .
it be a good feeling to be able to say that he be from our delegation and i be , i think , entitle to feel a little proud of him .
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
mr president , the commission have s resignation have also create a culture of fear amongst many official within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .
the call to make a cultural u-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seem to me a very fundamental one .
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spend .
it would be marvellous if this report be to give the green light to result-orient spend of this kind , with all the work organise on that basis .
this be the best support we can give to european democracy .
if , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifty and cross over into the next century , we be witness a very special moment indeed .
mr president , first of all , congratulation to michiel van hulten for his first report .
it be a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .
mr van hulten , i think you deserve a medal for your effort .
there be two point which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the eldr .
firstly , there be the commissioner have individual responsibility .
this must be regulate during the igc .
secondly , as already mention by my colleague , mr mulder , the eldr be of the opinion that the european parliament should also be investigate by independent expert .
this will contribute hugely towards re-establish the confidence of the european citizen in this institution .
we at the european parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reform commission as long as we do not search our heart and put our own house in order as well .
only when all european institution be reform will we have the open , democratic and decisive europe which our citizen now finally deserve .
mr president , i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he be present to the house .
i be sure that it will serve , amongst other thing , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up effort to find a consensus amongst the group .
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reform the commission , demand by our citizen .
this parliament have often heard the desire to reform the commission express , even by its president .
it now appear that this desire be more serious .
this parliament anxiously await this complete reform programme .
the report that we be debate today intend to give political force to many of the recommendation of the committee of expert commission by this parliament .
mr prodi said he would act anyway , that he prefer to get thing right , but that fear of not get thing right would not prevent him from acting .
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it be , i can assure him that he will have the support of this house in the reform process .
we want a strong commission , which can act in a independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
commissioner should not be consider senior official but rather politician in office .
therefore , the report allow them to be member of political party and to be member of political body affiliate to their party .
perhaps the reference to the post be imprecise .
i do not know your exact view in this respect , mr kinnock , but it be clear that we want commissioner who be politically strong and politically commit .
we want a structure which allow every euro to be spent effectively , and our account demonstrate that this be not happening at present .
mr president , the santer commission come to grief because financial control fail all down the line .
therefore , the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reform be swiftly undertake here and financial control be back in working order .
naturally , this be only to be welcome .
what i do not understand be why this have to come at a price , as it be , that be , of have to dispense with independent - and i stress , independent - prior approval .
up until now , the commission have s payment could only be made when the authorise officer sign the appropriate order and the financial controller give his approval in the form of a visa .
and so it be the " two key " principle that apply here .
a single key be to suffice in future .
the financial controller be no longer to make advance check , if all go to plan as regard the reform currently under discussion within the commission .
if you will pardon me for saying so , mr kinnock , what you be propose be a little like abolish the police because they be unable to prevent crime .
what we really need to focus on , however , be making the check more effective .
this could be achieve by no longer insist , in future , that the financial controller furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .
it be precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up control nothing at all .
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a target manner , that be , only in case of uncertainty or risk .
however , the financial controller must work independently .
that be the crucial difference between our plan and those of the commission , when it talk in term of decentralisation .
it be obviously the commission have s intention to make the financial control official subordinate to the individual directorates-general , but this be precisely what we do not want .
surely we have learnt this much from the event surrounding the leonardo affair , when the internal examiner in the relevant directorate-general issue warning , but these be neither heed nor pass on .
therefore , independence be prerequisite for effective check .
that be the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control subscribe to .
indeed , the new commission have now declare itself in favour of follow-up check have this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
i believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow have s vote .
mrs theato have already express as much and i be only too willing to support her in this regard .
mr president , a couple of year ago , the previous commission try once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structure .
this led to strike and smear campaign by intransigent trade union , whereupon the proposal be abandon and replace by a wishy-washy compromise .
this be stupid of the old commission , and parliament be of no help on that occasion .
when i read mr van hulten have s passage about personnel policy , i be afraid that parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issue and just spout a lot of hot air .
there be too many right , too many regulation and too little room for leadership .
there be no backbone , and no tooth .
where be the beef ?
and i would also say this to you , commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it be british .
romano prodi promise a revolution .
you have said some powerful and worthwhile thing yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issue , the one where it hurt !
sort out the tangle of staff allowance .
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it say here in the report , but as a management tool .
ensure too , that train become a management tool .
do not listen to the report have s demand that temporary staff should have their employment confirm .
it be the post which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employ on a temporary basis .
we have not do this so far , and this be something you ought to be instrumental in changing .
mr president , i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i vote for it .
so i refer to the thing i do not agree with .
i do not agree with the paragraph in relation to parliament .
this report be about the commission .
parliament be a separate subject .
there be no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission .
in addition to that , there be the question of duty-free .
that be a stick use to beat the commission by the duty-free lobby who resent the fact that the commission abolish duty-free in airport .
it be not worthy of being brought into this report either .
most of the report be about financial control .
that be reasonable because it come from the budgetary control committee .
but we should not create the impression that vast amount of european resource be being put at risk by carelessness in the european commission .
after all , it be only 1 % of gdp , by comparison with national spend .
so carelessness within the commission in the spend of money be not likely to put at risk vast quantity of money .
we should get it into perspective .
it be important to remember that .
the business of the european commission be very little about spend money .
they have very little of it .
i be not one of the people who agree that there be a vast lack of trust .
if there be , we have generate it in this house in the past year .
i have be here for 20 year and found absolute trust between the council , the commission and parliament .
that be a gross exaggeration of what the difficulty be .
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistake that cause the resignation of the commission that go before it .
while there be problem - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
mr president , i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .
the process of reform have be going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seem to prevail in the commission .
the commission have s administration simply do not function particularly well .
naturally , there be good , capable employee in the commission , and they be in the majority .
but we need radical reform .
there be too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
people should have clearly-defined power to take decision for which they should also be accountable .
the financial regulation should be amend .
we agree that we should have better control of the finance .
it be just a question of how .
the commission and the committee of independent expert be in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .
we should be careful about this .
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
it be not enough simply to carry out spot check once the money have be spent .
this would allow too many anomalous project to slip through .
instead , we should be reform and decentralise control .
the commission do not have enough staff .
and the commission should be able to refuse new task if it do not also get the extra staff it need .
the staffing system be too rigid .
there should be a more frequent rotation of employee , especially at the top of the hierarchy .
it should also be much easy to sack inefficient and incompetent employee .
i be therefore very please that the disciplinary procedure be to be reform .
after all , the very bad experience so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it be that we carry out reform .
mr president , commissioner , first of all , i cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this be , on the whole , a dutch-british-scandinavian debate where the speaker be concern .
perhaps this be a little worrying .
i hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relation between the commission and parliament be on the way to being resolve .
we must get away from the idea that we be rush to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one .
as mr blak said , we must instead establish a system with clear role .
first of all , we need tough regulation , which can be implement .
code of conduct and ethical committee be not enough .
there need to be tough rule state , among other thing , what may be decentralise , what may be outsource and what be independent .
what we need , then , be basic administrative regulation for the eu , for its institution and for the eu in its relation with the member state .
these be what be missing .
we have ask for a public prosecutor have s office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the eu .
we should make a good deal of progress if the commission be to adopt , as binding regulation , the ombudsman have s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
the van hulten report be a step in the right direction , but it be not enough .
secondly , we must also clarify our own audit role .
the court of auditor be to monitor the extent to which action be incompatible with the regulation , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .
it be the european parliament which be to carry out the political evaluation .
we do not hunt down criminals. that be olaf have s job .
tell me what national parliament , for example , be hand all preliminary investigation document .
mr president , i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
i be please that i can address him now in dutch , now that mr van den berg have just do so .
otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
i would like to say that this report represent a huge improvement , also with its amendment .
i be from the social committee and rapporteur on our committee be always proud to receive 100 amendment because then they know that they have table a interesting topic .
i think that this be also the case here , but i think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talk about these 100 amendment .
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee be mr pomé ruiz , who be spanish and have hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective .
mr president , one of the key aspect which have be mention be , to my mind , the rapporteur have s proposal for the standing committee on standard in public administration .
a very important proposal indeed .
i be only very surprise that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one table by mrs morgan , because she want to scrap it altogether .
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
i do not know whether this be to appease mr kinnock , but i happen to know mr kinnock .
he be happy to hear what our demand be and be quite prepare to be flexible if he consider it necessary .
in my opinion , such a far-reaching scorch earth policy be really unnecessary .
finally , the issue of official .
actually , i do not entirely share mr haarder have s view .
i do agree that the section on official have , in fact , be complete totally inadequately .
first of all , the importance of a public service in general be not at all emphasise .
secondly , all kind of proposal be nevertheless being moot , and we have to ask ourselves whether these be terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
for example , we be currently look into taos. this be a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the commission .
these two consideration be diametrically oppose to each other , and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .
mr president , ever since plato have s have republic have , the western world have regularly be tempt to replace government by the people with government by expert .
our parliament first ask expert to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they take advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .
this lesson in wisdom be 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
this will not help us to reform the european institution whilst fully respect democratic institution .
the van hulten report start out as a brilliant one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieve .
unfortunately , it be then change , and change for the worse , which turn it into a document which in fact , propose something that we cannot accept .
mr president , mr van hulten , your work be worthy of being qualify as enterprising , arduous and complex , and i believe this be important in a first report .
please therefore accept what i be about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be rich .
this report seem to me to be redundant , long-winded , confuse and lack in accuracy in the term use .
perhaps have redundant have be the most serious epithet , and you be not responsible for this .
it be the responsibility of this parliament .
clearly we be await this reform from the commission , we be await the proposal which the commission be going to make to us and this parliament will have to express its opinion on them .
meanwhile , we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence .
have long-winded have .
i be not going to mention the length of this report .
i do not know if it break the record for all the resolution present here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly do .
it be also have confusing have .
i be not going to return to what have be said about the analysis of question concerning parliament .
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
and finally , mr president , frankly , i be not going to give example , but there be many case in which legal language be use with a alarming lack of accuracy .
mr president , the scope and highly detail nature of the proposal for necessary reform measure show just how important these reform be .
when one consider the event that have set these endeavour in motion though , it be only too clear as to why there be a need for them .
hope and expectation be raise high still by the strong message sent out by commissioner prodi and kinnock in plenary and in the committee on budgetary control .
the concept of transparency stand out in the report .
secure this be a major priority .
the importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasise enough .
this be not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it be about showing good will towards the citizen .
we must win back their faith in eu politics .
the citizen demand rapid and open access to the institution and call for eu provision to be comprehensible to them .
this be what enable them to understand what be going on. they want to see the politics of success and believe that this be how any politically mature citizen could expect to be serve
whether or not the reform succeed depend , to a very large extent , on the commission have s own initiative .
however , it annoy me when i heard today that the commission be now saying that it only wish to discuss the interim report with parliament on a informal basis .
i believe , mr kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieve on a personal level , the commission still have quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectation .
so if she have any lecture to offer they be best contain within this house .
mr president , may i begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what i hear , the pains-accept work of mr van hulten in prepare his report .
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguish career as a representative .
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than be absolutely necessary .
when this house consider the second report of the committee of expert last september , i pledge on behalf of the incoming commission that the report would be treat as a fundamental ingredient in the commission be reform proposal .
i be sure that mr pome ruiz be encourage by that .
there be nothing therefore that be open-ended or vague about the report which i have have the honour to compile .
the consider view of this parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five week will for obvious reason be of great significance .
i would say to mr elles that we be most definitely in listen mode .
hence the transmission .
this be essential for a executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this house , but more generally to the european public .
naturally , sensible safeguard be require to protect specially sensitive information , but the case where these be need should be kept to the minimum possible .
i have repeatedly emphasise that , indeed not just as a commissioner , but in 25 or 30 year of campaign .
that most certainly be the intention of the commission .
financial management and control be obviously a crucial area of reform .
as the house know and have repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the union be financial intervention have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or a adjustment in procedure .
several member have made that point again in the course of today be debate .
we share the view , forcefully express by the committee of independent expert , and repeat in this draft resolution that the time have come for a thorough overhaul of our rule and procedure .
the mean of doing that be set out in the reform strategy and the commission will present its proposal for a radical recast of the financial regulation in april .
parliamentary support in pursue that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
i share the view express by mrs theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangement without a change in the law .
change in the law be fundamental .
that service will open on 1 may this year .
it will be head by a professionally qualify member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guarantee through a new provision to be add in the financial regulation .
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audit .
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control system will definitely not mean relaxing them .
the propose change will make the system more effective , both in term of input and in term of measure and accountable outcome .
i can also specifically assure the house that we be not going for what be sometimes call " a big bang approach " .
financial control have s ex ante visa for each spend department will only be relinquish as and when the internal control system in a department be show to be fully adequate .
i be somewhat surprise that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution do not appear to address the fundamental criticism of the current centralise financial control function made in both report of the committee of independent expert .
that committee be very clear about the need to abolish the centralise ex ante visa .
it be clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
in addition , i do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflect the opinion of the court of auditor in 1997 .
naturally the court will be able to give its consider opinion on the propose change to the financial regulation but it be useful to recall mr karlsson have s comment to this house last month .
" the commission be internal control " he said " be not forceful enough in prevent incorrect operation .
for instance , the financial controller grant a positive a priori visa in most of the case of mismanagement or irregularity recently uncover .
at the same time , the internal audit function be carry out in a uncoordinate way by several body , notably the same financial controller , the inspectorate general and by some unit operating directorates-general . "
the centralise ex ante approval system be doubtlessly originally design to ensure carefulness but , over the year , it have have the perverse effect of reduce the extent to which manager feel responsible for their decision .
i do not believe that there be any real disagreement between us on this .
i take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable member be that there should be a carefully manage transition .
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable member will see when they read the reform strategy document .
our objective , the committee have s objective , the court of auditor have objective be not to abolish financial control , it be to get rid of and improve upon centralise financial control .
before leave this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintain pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of month .
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concern report by commission official of perceive wrong-doing .
since june of last year , the olaf regulation have give better guidance to staff about report possible irregularity .
we propose to complement those provision by define the right and obligation for official to report suspect wrong-doing through internal channel but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .
the possibility of use specify external channel will also be address .
we be seek to implement best practice .
as a corollary , there will be safeguard for official who be the subject of false allegation .
a communication later this year will give full detail .
i do not think parliament will be disappoint by what we will propose .
i be persuade , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on use external body to enforce existing provision on financial liability .
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedure to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .
and we will propose the establishment of a interinstitutional disciplinary board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of parliament .
a communication in june will set out the full proposal for change .
standard in public life be the next main section of the report before the house .
with the introduction of a series of code of conduct the current commission have begin to develop a explicit ethical framework .
this will be take a step further with a proposal in june for a interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standard in public life .
that be in line with the draft resolution .
a important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standard and to supervise common and separate code of conduct for the institution .
i welcome parliament be support for that .
we be also currently examine how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for document , made in paragraph 50 of mr van hulten be report .
the draft resolution rightly recall the commission be accountability to this parliament .
president prodi and vice-president de palacio and other colleague have demonstrate the commission be practical commitment to that .
i hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relation between our institution which will include update rule on access to document .
the point be very properly raise by mr elles and refer to by mrs thor .
i be sure they be aware that in mid-december we officially receive the draft framework agreement with parliament .
we be now wait for parliament to decide when it wish to begin negotiation on the text .
we be very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
the report rightly emphasise the central importance that human resource policy must have in reform .
i also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system be no longer adapt to the need of our institution .
it certainly block the advance and mobility of people with prove capability .
while the reform strategy white paper will clearly outline our idea on these and other point , detail and precision be obviously essential .
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming month .
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house .
it be , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with parliament , as a institution , on central matter of common interest , notably pay and pension and the revision of the staff regulation .
the early thought of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
i conclude by refer to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the house relate to the resource requirement of our policy for change .
that be most certainly relevant .
we be sure that there will be a important " reform dividend " as the modernisation measure begin to foster increase efficiency and better management in the use of resource .
it be very clear , however , that part of the commission service be already very stretch .
parliament have frequently made that point .
secondly , it be also clear that reform will require some new investment in train for skill and in technology .
thirdly , it be very clear that increase preparation for enlargement must be undertake .
they be already have implication for resource availability .
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tie the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .
the commission therefore welcome paragraph 15 of mr van hulten be report .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting be close at 11.15 p.m. )
middle east peace process ( continuation )
the next item be the continuation of the council and commission statement on the middle east peace process .
such be life .
i hope that honourable member will excuse me if i be not able to stay to the end of the debate as i would , in all normal circumstance , wish to do .
the debate be fix for this morning and on that basis i have arrange to see visitor from the balkans this evening .
so i hope i can count on the understanding of the house on this occasion .
it be not something , i assure you , which i would wish to make a practice of .
there be reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track .
the situation of the palestinian have always be the core issue of the conflict .
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east .
israeli and palestinian have made substantial progress in implement the sharm el-sheikh memorandum .
although there have be some slippage , i trust that the remaining israeli troop redeployment will materialise soon .
i be reassure that this be also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat , when they met on monday .
honourable member will know that one particular concern of ours have be that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .
this be far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the us and russian co-sponsor as well as the regional party .
we be charge with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
the beginning of the talk with syria pave the way for a convene of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month .
i look forward to attend that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push thing forward again .
the european union have a important role to play in the peace process , as all side - palestinian , israeli , their arab neighbour and the unite state - have acknowledge .
nor be our role confine to that of banker .
we must be prepare to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive middle east peace deal come with a hefty price tag .
the commission be already considering the implication for the european union of the recent encourage development .
we intend to share our more detail thought on the matter with parliament and council soon .
but let me remind honourable member that the european union be no slouch when it come to financial support for the peace process .
we be the large of all donor to the palestinian .
we have also offer very substantial support to jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt .
with the israeli we have establish close cooperation in a number of area of particular interest to them .
the community contribution of over eur 600 million in grant and loan between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpin the palestinian authority and contribute substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorate physical infrastructure in the west bank and gaza .
european union member state together contribute another eur 860 million during that crucial period .
in this context , let me applaud the important step that the palestinian authority have recently take to improve budgetary transparency .
president arafat will be meeting the council of minister next week .
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous step to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .
the commission be actively involve in those effort .
the commission have also step up its plan support for regional cooperation project between israeli and arab .
we commit more than eur 20 million for such project last year .
this package include renew assistance for people-to-people activity and cross-border cooperation where israeli and arab meet on non-governmental and expert level .
member will recall that the european union be the large financial donor to the overall effort in bring reconciliation to the people of the middle east .
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern lebanon , the only middle eastern area with a ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable effort .
we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in lebanon as a whole .
a solution be need to the palestinian refugee problem - these be the large group of refugee in the world , number nearly 5 million people - a indication of the enormous challenge ahead .
we must support initiative increasing the availability and improve the distribution and management of the region be very scarce water resource .
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we be encourage close regional cooperation in a number of area , bring all the country concern together in a joint endeavour to address their common problem .
i want to underline that point .
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be ask and expect to provide .
i hope i can add that we will want to provide that .
we have made progress in recent month and week , as mr gama mention early .
but it be inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulty and disappointment on the way .
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligation and challenge that will be create by that outcome .
i hope the house will understand that .
mr president , commissioner patten have our understanding .
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid be usually more fluid and , therefore , i hope to see him there soon .
the tone of the news in the media on the recent event in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
i honestly believe that a evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
in this sense , i share commissioner patten have s positive attitude .
let me explain : it be true that the israeli government have delay the third hand-over of west bank territory to the palestinian authority .
this be naturally on the condition that the delay do not exceed three week , as prime minister barak have promise .
i would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve difference , which be still no doubt profound , between the party .
it be clear to everyone that this be essential to guarantee security in the area and to cooperate in the development which be need to heal the serious social difference which exist .
there be absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the president of the european parliament to the region will contribute to this .
mr president , i want to thank commissioner patten for his detail account .
i should like to say that i agree with the tone which galeote quecedo have s speech set here .
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process .
it be , of course , a peace process which be finally under way .
if we think of how the process be look a year ago , the difference between then and now be like that between night and day , despite difficulty and delay .
i want to emphasise four point .
first of all , the sharm el-sheikh agreement contain , as everyone know , a concrete timetable for the implementation of israel have s commitment .
this apply both to the interim agreement and to the hebron and wye agreement .
while the negotiation on the final peace settlement have begin , i think it be important to keep the two process apart .
a lack of progress in the final status negotiation should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreement .
the second point relate to syria .
there , the border question be obviously central .
how negotiation be proceed there , we still do not know .
what be important , however , be that they have begin .
a important question in this context be the future distribution of water .
as thing be at present , the golan height account for between a third and a sixth of israel be water supply .
the third aspect be the peace negotiation in syria which be closely link to the issue of israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon .
accord to unifil , there be now concrete sign that israel be prepare to withdraw , which be something we welcome .
there too , of course , outstanding matter in dispute be the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugee .
my last point concern the future palestinian state .
this may be proclaim in the course of this year , with or without israel have s support .
the barak government have give to understand that it intend to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .
even if negotiation be not complete by september of this year , there be nothing in the relevant treaty to prevent a palestinian state from being proclaim after that date .
this be something to which we all want to contribute .
more specifically , however , i would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , israel and syria be on speak term again to resolve their difference of opinion .
the recent negotiation be already a important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east .
it be , therefore , regrettable that these peace talk have be suspend for the time being .
indeed , both party will need to make huge effort .
lasting peace in the region can only be achieve by mean of a agreement which guarantee the security of the israeli border , as well as syria have s integrity .
it be also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relation and to establish constant dialogue .
nevertheless , it be still regrettable that the european union , one of the most important financial donor , be still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
this peace process in the middle east be one of the priority of the european union have s common foreign and security policy .
this be where mr solana , the high representative to the council , could come into his own .
the commission and member state also have to be encourage to support project which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nation in the region .
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
in this respect , we support libya have s participation , provide that it recognis human right , renounce support for terrorist and fully support the peace process .
there be still , needless to say , many unresolve problem and unanswered question , also involve the palestinian .
mr president , it be pleasing that , despite certain delay and problem , the peace negotiation be going on both between israel and palestine and between israel and syria .
the moment of truth be approach .
be israel prepare to comply with the un have s resolution and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the arab area which be conquer in 1967 ?
will israel let palestinian refugee return or be give compensation ?
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan ?
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
will syria fully accept israel have s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lie with the occupy country , israel , do not prevent the arab partner from also have a considerable share of the responsibility .
peace in the middle east concern us all , however .
it be therefore good that the eu should act as a godparent to the palestinian state .
against this background , i want to conclude with a remarkable story from sweden where a international intergovernmental conference on hitle have s extermination of the jew be being held , which be obviously a welcome initiative .
of 47 state invite from all corner of the world , not one of them , however , be a arab state include in the eu have s barcelona process .
this have be interpret as indicate that the arab attitude towards israel should be regard by european as being similar to the nazis have anti-semitism , which of course be completely incorrect .
the arab world have s criticism of israel have be found upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , algeria have s fight for freedom against france .
but today , egypt , jordan and palestine have peace treaty with israel .
i therefore wonder whether commissioner patten do not agree with me that it would have be only right and proper to have invite at least one arab state to the holocaust conference in stockholm .
it be high time there be peace in the middle east. it be time to end the era which begin with the balfour declaration in 1917 and the arab-israeli war of 1948 .
i refer principally to the palestine-israel question , but the same also apply to the territory which have be occupy in the golan since 1967 and in southern lebanon since 1982 .
however , israel be not the only country concern with security .
between the period when the oslo agreement be sign and 17 october 1999 , 174 000 dunam of land be confiscate , 8 462 of which have be take under mr barak have s government .
tree have be uproot , house be still being demolish and , above all , water supply have be reduce or refuse , especially in east jerusalem , while the settlement continue and be growing constantly .
nevertheless , there be no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive step have be take : negotiation , at least , have resume .
but in the middle east , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the palestinian do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .
all the international community have to do be implement resolution 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .
we be concern by the deferment of the building of relation with syria , as well as mr barak have s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the israeli army and the sharm el ­ -sheikh agreement .
we feel it be extremely important for the european union to play a political role in negotiation which match its economic aid .
we cannot be content with a role backstage. we must be leading protagonist while stay off a collision course with the unite state , as minister gama said .
i be deeply disappoint at the news this week that the peace talk between israel and syria have be suspend .
i very much hope that a compromise can be reach to overcome this so that the peace negotiation can be resume at a very early date .
nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress have be made in the middle east of late .
political leader must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to a overall peace settlement within the middle east .
i know that if agreement can be reach between syria and israel , the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum .
the settler at the golan height will demand to be compensate and there will have to be guarantee of security .
if syria would be willing to offer concession on the security question then the prospect of a successful resolution to the israel / syria question might be promising .
on the issue of palestine , i recognise that there be still some difficulty with regard to the implementation of some aspect of the wye agreement .
the key problem area at the moment include the difficulty of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territory .
these issue have clearly be holding up progress on the permanent status negotiation , although , i believe , these talk will not be held up indefinitely .
currently , both side seem to have accept that nothing will be agree until everything be agree .
mr president , the various motion for resolution table in parliament more or less represent the situation in the middle east .
there be those who be in favour of new agreement between israel and syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the middle east issue .
indeed , the time have come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
mr president , the israeli author , amos oz , manage to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiate table between the israeli and syrian recently .
he be under the impression that the syrian thought that , in exchange for the golan height , all they have to do be to fax the israeli a receipt .
oz have s impression be also echo in the israeli press .
it contrast prime minister barak have s personal peace effort and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of damascus , president assad , at the negotiation in the unite state .
surely assad would be barak have s ideal negotiate partner and not the foreign affair minister .
and the israeli be certainly not impress by the discourteous behaviour of minister farouk al-shara in shepherdstown .
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak be plainly insulting .
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic nicety in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?
well , the syrian be quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .
at the end of the day , israeli voter can still express a opinion on the return of the golan .
all the resolution submit express the sincere wish for great european involvement in the peace process .
i would like to finish off by ask the european council and commission a question .
how accurate be the press report which state that the portuguese presidency have already pledge troop as a peacekeeping force in the golan ?
the suspension of the talk between syria and israel be not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east .
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authority and israel be also suspend at the moment .
what can the european union do in these circumstance ?
unfortunately , very little .
when we consider that a conference will soon be held in moscow , it become clear that the european union have s presence in this peace process be somewhat pitiful .
i should just like to make three comment which commissioner patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reason , a member can formulate more openly .
first , i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authority .
but we have enough agreement now : oslo , wye plantation , sharm el-sheikh .
we have enough agreement ; they just need to be implement .
my second point concern the resumption of negotiation between syria and israel .
i consider this to be very encourage news .
but we have also learned this week that mr barak will not be travel to washington and that the negotiation cannot therefore be continue .
i should like to make it quite clear : if the golan height be return to syria , the problem in this region will be solve .
that would be a similar situation .
my third and last point concern the role of the european union .
you know that you will always have our support here in parliament , and that include your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time come to finance it .
then we will have play the role which be commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
this hope be contain in our motion for a resolution. we hope for a fair and balance agreement base on respect for sovereignty and the right to live securely within safe and recognise border .
all the foreign troop , including therefore the syrian force , must withdraw from lebanon in accordance with resolution 520 of the unite nation security council .
dare we hope for a israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july 2000 , the date promise by ehud barak ?
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbour to the north ?
we really hope and believe so .
never have the party be so determine .
following the attack in hadera on monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
at midday , mr gama refer to the financial and commercial support provide by europe to the region .
despite everything , we be being force to recognise that the resumption of the peace process be largely due to the work of washington .
like other arab country before them , the syrian choose the american to sponsor the negotiation .
this be the choice also made by israel where europe suffer from a partisan public image , and this be a fact , not a judgement .
this be now the opportunity to reiterate to mr patten , mr solana and mr moratino how much we be rely on their effort to include europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
although it be difficult for europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .
area of freedom , security and justice
mr president , 1999 be the year of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , of the communitisation of the schengen agreement and of the extraordinary tampere council .
these have be the most important moment in the council have s expression of its political will to establish a area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .
it have also reach a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposal for civil cooperation .
this have be the year in which policy on justice and home affair have be provide with a community framework .
they have be put into the hand of a single commissioner , mr antonio vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .
it be as if the council have more than one face and two hand and what one sign up to , the other begrudge .
despite all the commitment made at the high level , the council do not manage to take the decision which it have envisage .
programme multiply and overlap and there be no way of ascertain level of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this parliament be unable to do so .
we have present the council with a series of question and i know that it be the will of the portuguese presidency to answer each and every one of them .
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament .
i said that there be no consistency between the decision take by the council and the policy actually carry out .
there be doubt in my group and doubt also persist in this house , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the schengen agreement into the community framework .
schengen have be incorporate , as we said early , into the acquis , but it have be do with very little transparency .
the same be true with regard to immigration policy .
we have amuse ourselves with a pile of report , but we have no idea what have happen to these initiative ; they have disappear .
we hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 be the year for expectation .
we hope that the council will also make a effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament .
the council have decide that justice and home affair policy must form part of the structure of the union .
the council can act in accordance with parliament have s decision , or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institution in this vitally important project .
if it choose the second approach , it must be aware that this present risk and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice be built .
alternatively , it could accept the offer of a agreement amongst the institution , in order to move forward in another way .
fulfil your obligation to parliament in a generous spirit , thus prepare for the future .
we be all aware that , to this end , it be essential for the council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which commissioner vitorino have the remit of establish .
i must stress once again the portuguese presidency have s earnest desire for political agreement to be reach on the scoreboard at the informal council in lisbon on 3 and 4 march .
and i must not forget the finnish presidency have s proposal for a council decision which be being consider in the multi-disciplinary group .
our relation with third country represent another important aspect of the fight against organise crime .
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress have be made on the legal protection of the euro , and the european parliament be being consult on a framework decision which be of fundamental strategic importance .
the french presidency have pass a important working document to us which set out various scenario for address and resolve the issue of democratic control and judicial control of europol .
for this reason , it be essential that the council have s debate on the future of europol and eurojust should be conduct in parallel , so that conclusion can be reach in parallel also .
we be familiar with parliament have s view and we know that parliament be aware of the view of the council have s legal adviser .
in this first speech , i would like to share with parliament the commission have s view of the most important event in 1999 .
i believe that i can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 be both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the union on issue of freedom , security and justice .
this project be not so much a project of the institution as a project of the citizen of our common union .
the union have s commitment to establish a area of freedom , security and justice be confirm at tampere .
1999 be also mark by the german presidency have s initiative to draw up a european charter of fundamental right .
in addition to these event , i would like to remind parliament of some item that be approve in 1999 .
the commission made a active contribution to the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and ultimately , in december , it present a proposal aim at establish a european refugee fund .
we also present a proposal for a decision on combate fraud and forgery of non-cash mean of payment .
in the field of european union legislation on combate financial crime , the commission present a proposal for a amend directive on money launder .
in 1999 , the commission also present its contribution towards a european action plan to combat drug , which underpin the strategy approve by the helsinki european council .
it will also , and above all , be a instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the european union have s institution towards the public .
it be for the public , therefore , that we be develop the area of freedom , security and justice .
in the coming week , i shall be making a tour of capital to sound out the opinion of the various minister for justice and home affair .
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .
and we hope , during the portuguese presidency , to present the final version to the justice and home affair council , taking account of the sounding that i have just mention .
it be my intention that this scoreboard should become a instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institution , and that it should also be a instrument for public scrutiny .
i also intend to continue discussion on the preparation of specific common procedural rule for simplify and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relate to small commercial and consumer claim , alimony claim and non-contested claim .
as a follow-up to the tampere and helsinki conclusion , the commission will be present its contribution to the preparation of a european union strategy to combat organise crime .
we will be organise and support action including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implement mutual recognition of judicial decision in criminal matter .
the commission will also support the presidency have s effort to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money launder , a eminently cross-pillar issue .
we be also prepare a communication to instigate a debate on mean of ensure great security in the information and knowledge society and in combate computer crime .
the recent restore of certain internal border control lead me to believe that we need a detail analysis of the condition for adopt a legislative instrument base on article 62 of the treaty .
lastly , i would like to state once again that the commission intend to be in the pole position in present proposal for implement the treaty of amsterdam .
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective role in exercise their right to initiative and in carry forward the legislative process itself .
as i have told parliament , the task before us be immense and ambitious , and the commission need to have the necessary human resource to respond to this challenge .
commissioner vitorino , although i would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , word have often fail me in the past when face with the conduct which the council have demonstrate towards us .
minister gome , i have , of course , heard what you have said and i hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the portuguese presidency .
i should like to raise three point which for us , as member of the ppe group , must be focal point when such a area be create .
first : a common asylum law must be create and the burden of absorbing refugee must be distribute .
the council must start by at long last ensure that eurodac be adopt in order to create the basic requirement for classify asylum seeker .
as far as a european asylum law be concern , a start be in fact made at vienna and tampere .
unfortunately , however , it have highlight the difficulty rather than propose solution .
i therefore call on the council representative to look beyond their national boundary and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole union .
similarly , it cannot be right for just a few member state willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .
agreement on burden share must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
secondly : the introduction of a europe-wide fight against organise crime , including by europol and eurojust .
the plan introduction of eurojust be one of our significant success from tampere and must now be implement forthwith .
we welcome the fact that europol have finally be able to start work .
we be not just calling for more control , and more control over europol ; our motto here be " less be sometimes more ! "
with most of europol employee currently engage in self-control for the purpose of data protection law and question being ask by 15 national parliament , we may have a great deal of control , but it be inefficient control .
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament , without hamper the work of europol .
at the same time , we support the establishment of a european police academy as suggest in tampere as a step in the right direction .
thirdly : the extension to parliament have s right in this context .
there be therefore a urgent need to grant parliament codecision right in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .
we want a area of freedom , security and justice for the citizen of europe , not against them .
mr president , i have nothing further to say to the council .
the previous speaker have quote me from the last committee meeting and said it all !
why do the council find it so hard to work with us in create a area of freedom , security and justice ?
i find this question more and more worrying .
allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view .
the establishment of a area of freedom , security and justice hover at the interface between the constituent element of national sovereignty .
so we have to draw our conclusion and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instrument available .
as a result , the government which need to do this and which recognise that need , also realise that , in implement this , they be taking away their own power .
then there be the european parliament , which be also complicate .
it have not quite take off in the european parliament and the council meet behind close door .
if the establishment of a area of freedom , security and justice be kept secret , then we shall not win the citizen over to it .
in other word , the stability of democracy be at stake if we discuss it .
this be why i frequently get so work up , but not over the council of minister .
generally , they too be elect member of parliament : mr gome , mr costa , commissioner vitorino , in principle we be all in the same boat .
however , i should like to make a appeal to the council apparatchik .
the following principle apply : he who prepare decision , in this case the council apparatchik , anticipate the decision , which be why the council apparatchik should demonstrate more democratic spirit .
i should just like to mention another aspect briefly because i do not have much time .
scoreboard sound like skateboard in german .
i say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulate what must be implement , when and by whom .
this vitorino plan be what we need : clear , precise project with a clear , define timetable .
mr vitorino , whom i would like to thank for his speech , can give us that , provide that he have the necessary financial and human resource .
let us give him those resource , then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain .
i warmly welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency be making justice and home affair one of its top priority or jewel in the crown .
i be also encourage by commissioner patten have s comment this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crisis .
perhaps that will end scandal like the failure of state to deploy in kosovo the police they promise .
i just want to highlight three area among many where we need quick progress .
the first be asylum .
it be essential to establish a single european system , but one base on fairness , full respect for the geneva convention and decent reception condition , including a end to routine detention .
decision on asylum should take month - not year .
let our citizen know that our common policy in justice and home affair be about freedom , not just about repression .
the last area i want to mention be convergence of civil and criminal justice system .
eurosceptic claim that this be a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on .
arrest and release in madrid , he be now being extradite after arrest in lisbon .
whatever the eurosceptic say , it be in all our interest to get cooperation in such matter .
finally , as have already be said , it be essential , and i hope that the igc will cover this , to move to codecision with the european parliament in these area , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .
mr president , all i can say about 1999 be this : how wonderful to feel the portuguese summer after the finnish winter .
i hope that it work out .
the tampere summit be certainly a important milestone in 1999 for europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
numerous question be still outstanding .
answer be still await .
since tampere , there have be a imbalance between positive action and mere declaration of intent .
regulation on nationality and the integration of people from third country be still outstanding .
on the other hand , quite specific action have be call for on the subject of safety of life .
the creation of a charter of fundamental right will be one of the important project in the immediate future .
however , it be difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implement legally when you think of the people who be not currently citizen of the union .
the europol agreement have now officially enter into force .
in tampere , the question of grant operational power be discuss .
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
the agreement also attract criticism with regard to eurodac .
parliament have amend the contractual text .
care must be take to ensure that the council comply with parliament have s modus operandi .
unfortunately , no initiative have yet materialise regard other matter and we still await them .
europe as a area of freedom , security and justice have so far be a area with no clear regulation in important sector .
and yet we owe this to the citizen of europe .
have listen to the justice and home affair minister , i be optimistic and i be assume that we will succeed in the next six month .
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this .
we be all aware of the enormous expectation of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all thing political require us to take specific action to tackle their problem .
this be the sine qua non condition for reconcile the popular and political sphere .
for europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
a proper plan for fighting unemployment must be establish for this be the scourge which be allow the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movement .
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrant and refugee .
the virtually systematic condition of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seeker be no longer acceptable .
all asylum-seeker must be entitle to a fair hearing and a appeal with suspensory effect .
last week , and somewhat by chance , i witness , at roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young woman , admittedly illegal immigrant , be being return to conakry .
they be treat like the worst criminal .
they be strip naked and drag along the floor by their hair , surround by a horde of state security police .
the portuguese presidency must put a end to this type of barbaric behaviour .
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who be flee dictatorship .
the commission have propose create a european fund for refugee to which parliament be favourably dispose .
instead of all this waffle about the budget grant to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .
the presidency and the council can realise what be incomprehensibly reject in tampere , even though this summit provide a important basis .
likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feeling in europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action .
the law against racism must be harmonise .
what direction do you intend to give to article 13 of the ec treaty ?
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for man and woman ?
how do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ?
we must take the best from each of our country .
in more general term , this presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority group and immigrant .
immigration be too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive response .
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrant in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seeker ?
mr president , there be a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
the european union be a economic powerhouse but we be not in a position to pontificate when it come to our treatment of refugee .
the level of racism in our society be terrifying .
racism in ireland be endemic .
it have be a relative shock to our political leader to find we must now take a share of the refugee that have be coming into the european union for a long time .
we be coming from behind in deal with the issue and the government be doing its utmost to catch up .
there be a willingness but fear pervade , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in ireland but throughout the european union .
and our current eu mantra be afsj : area for freedom , security and justice .
behind this lie another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such a area .
and who be not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
the problem be just that this be not something the eu can introduce by mean of legislative decree and other supranational resolution .
freedom , security and justice be the root system of any society , reflect its history , corporate experience and political development .
a system of this kind be not something the eu can introduce without society have s sustain damage as a result .
but it be precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .
the agenda be not design to secure justice for the citizen .
that be already secure by mean of the various national legal system .
the agenda be design to transfer vital part of society have s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the eu have s control .
it be concern with increase integration which , as part of a duplicitous package , involve increase repression and control .
you just have to think of all the resolution concerning fort europa , schengen , eurodac etc .
any democrat can spot two key problem .
first of all , the initiative which have be plan be completely unrealistic .
how be it envisage that the eu have s institution , which be already stretch well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious project concern to fruition ?
think of last year have s deadly criticism of the commission have s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .
it also , of course , find indirect expression in the question .
but , secondly , the project will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracy .
as long as the eu revolve around the internal market , only the body be being attack .
now , it be the soul .
mr president , today the people of northern ireland see a strange irony .
let me just look at the figure from the day that the agreement be sign .
in 1998 , we have 55 murder .
in 1999 , we have 7 murder and that do not include the omagh bomb where 29 be kill and 300 injure .
between 1998 and 1999 , loyalist assault and shot 123 people , while republican assault and shot 93 people .
charge brought against loyalist in 1999 total 193 , while those against republican total 97 .
mr president , that situation cannot continue and need remedy .
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam have set a important objective for the union .
this be a task which all mep , the council and the commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as have be said already , of a area of freedom , security and justice .
the recent law on alien adopt in my country , spain , and in belgium , be a reminder that there be a urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .
my third and final point relate to the external activity of the union in the field of immigration and asylum .
we must not and cannot give the impression that the union exclusively wish to defend itself from a avalanche of refugee and economic migrant .
finally , in relation to the charter of fundamental right , the citizen of europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
the euro , employment , even security , be not enough .
they need a have european soul have , as a distinguish spanish professor once said .
mr president , unlike some of the previous speaker , i want to go back to the word of our portuguese minister and mr vitorino .
this trio be word be like music to our ear as mr ceyhun have said .
as with all music it need to be a fine tune and properly orchestrate .
many of us of here be very optimistic about the next six month .
the tune that will be play will be one that the people of europe will be listen to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
as describe this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tune we heard during the european election and over the last few month .
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for a area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .
one area though be extremely important , and this house must be involve in it : namely scrutiny .
and we must make certain that the detail be applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different country .
i should like to draw attention to some of the aspect of the resolution before us this afternoon , one or two of which be refer to early on .
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial system in the various country and the cooperation on crime .
that be a area that european citizen will respond to and will be happy about .
but the commission and council must know that there be many people in this house who have reservation about the eurodac system , for example .
mr schulz said early on that he be not certain about the definition of have scoreboard have .
anyone who be english or british or follow cricket know what a scoreboard be .
a scoreboard tell people the score ; it have to be up-to-date and it have to be clear and visible .
i be sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that be so .
at the end of six month i hope that the music be still play and that the european people be still listen .
amsterdam and tampere have give us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by mrs terrón today show .
i would like to make three brief point .
the first be that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament .
let us stop the shadow-boxing .
let us drop the elaborate charade and let us respect the duty that the treaty impose on us and the timescale allow for full democratic debate .
involve us please in your discussion on both policy and process .
let us not pretend that national parliament be able to exercise effective democratic control of government activity in this area .
my second point be that we need a properly resource commission .
we have establish a new directorate-general , yet it have only 70 people all told .
there be a agreement to double this number , but i understand that , so far , not a single new person have arrive .
we be setting the commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resource that the commission need .
finally , on the content of the debate , i welcome the fact that the presidency have put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
all good thing come in three , especially in our policy area .
two hundred year ago it be liberty , equality and fraternity , and thing go along very well until the government of the left raise equality above the others .
although the main achievement in the construction of a area of freedom , security and justice should be mention , we must remember that there be still room for progress .
the role of the court of justice be still too limit and communitisation be incomplete .
the unilateral decision by belgium to re-establish border control be a clear illustration of this .
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political right of all european resident be to be regret .
although action plan establish by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flow in the future , these plan do nothing to improve human right , civil liberty and the economic situation in the country concern .
we know that readmission clause be include in the cooperation and association agreement .
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of have non-refoulement have [ no turning back ] .
furthermore , it should be note that these provision be adopt within the council by a procedure without debate and without consult parliament .
however , the main concern remains ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i would like to join my colleague in welcoming the representative of the council as well as the commissioner .
i thank them for their statement to the house .
i look to the portuguese presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which be do by the finnish presidency in bring forward coordinate plan and action between the member state .
this be a belgian government measure which fly in the face of the schengen treaty .
i lodge a write complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on 23 december .
mr president , esteem gentlemen from portugal , especially the council representative , you face great expectation on our part .
i should like to give you a example of one way in which you can meet these expectation relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
i refer to eurodac .
we vote clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with a implementation committee , which would be attach to the commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
we be of the opinion that eurodac be becoming a reality .
even in tampere , we be of the opinion that eurodac be becoming a reality .
this be a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
my urgent request on behalf of the group be that you do everything to ensure that eurodac be implement immediately as a instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as a instrument to speed up asylum procedure .
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
mr president , minister , commissioner , the 1999 harvest of decision be indeed rich , so much so that it become difficult to gather , i.e. to put those decision into practice .
i refer in particular to the council and to the inertia of the member state in implement the decision they have jointly made .
from what i have said , it must be obvious to you that the european parliament be not prepare to simply play the role of observer .
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
how do you intend to go about integrate immigrant into the community , reunite them with their family and recognise their right and duty on a equal footing with those of the citizen of europe ?
in light of this new international demographic class portray by expert at the un , be it not about time you abandon your traditional , conservative view on refugee and immigrant ?
i have great expectation for the portuguese presidency .
mr president , i welcome much , indeed most , of what have be said in this debate .
but i want to add a word of caution .
there be also court in karlsruhe , london , lisbon , dublin and edinburgh .
we must make sure that what we do make clear sense .
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdiction about right , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the high possible common standard and to find way of secure these .
but we must look always to subsidiarity .
like everybody in this house , i want freedom , justice and security .
i do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion .
madam president , lady and gentlemen , i would very quickly like to make one point. various member raise question about the portuguese presidency .
( sustain applause )
thank you , minister .
the debate be close .
mr president , i be grateful for the council have s oral , and also write , reply .
their efficiency have be truly remarkable .
i will save a few second because i want to propose to the council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the committee on citizen have right and freedom , justice and home affair .
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these reply and to express our concern to the commission as well .
i also hope that the same be do in relation to parliamentary control .
representative of the council , within the next month we be going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament .
question time ( council )
the next item be question time ( b5-0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine question to the council .
question no 1 by ( h-0780 / 99 ) :
mr president , the council wish to point out that turkey be a signatory to the convention on nuclear safety , the objective of which should allay the fear express by mr souladaki .
the convention , as you will be aware , also cover the prevention of accident which have radiological effect and the limitation of such effect when incident of this kind occur .
thank you for your answer .
however , i would just like to add the following. turkey be only look to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
nevertheless , rumour have it that it plan to buy candu reactor of the type acquire by pakistan and india which be use for nuclear weapon .
in this respect , the issue require close examination , because the sensitive situation in the caucasus region could heighten people have s suspicion .
my second point concern the safety of these plant .
however , we cannot carry out test on nuclear plant which be in operation ; it be just not possible .
with this in mind , it go without saying that nuclear plant a priori should not be built in area prone to earthquake .
in this respect , and because turkey be situate on the periphery of the european union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .
that be our role and this be the point of my question .
i recognise the relevance of the argument that mr souladaki have put forward .
this be , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
furthermore , it will be evident that this be a matter that do not only affect turkey , in view of that country have s proximity to the existing territory of the european union .
it also affect other state neighbouring the eu with which we maintain relation .
this question will naturally be one of our key concern , and the european commission will not fail to take this into account .
thank you , mr president and thank you president-in-office of the council .
i be sure the president-in-office of the council be a very nice man and be very kind to his wife and his child and his dog .
however , forgive me if i be a little sceptical of the reply you have just give me .
i do not believe that the statement made within the council and the vote be available to the public immediately .
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
however , i would like to say , mr newton dunn , that the result of this kind of process for transparency be quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .
we therefore consider that the general secretariat of the council be at present making available to the public all essential information regard the council have s function as a legislative body .
i do not consider that the council try to answer my question .
i do not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission have still not tabled. instead , my question concern the interpretation in principle of article 255 of the treaty of amsterdam .
do this permit legislation also to be pass concerning national law on transparency and not only in connection with the three institution of the european union refer to there ?
i should like to have a answer to that question .
do the council consider that , on the basis of article 255 of the treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulate , that be to say legislation not relate to the eu have s institution ?
mr sjöstedt , the answer that i give be the only answer possible .
nevertheless , i would like to say that any interpretation of article 255 of the treaty must also be link to the principle of subsidiarity .
at the moment , there be no concrete proposal which would allow us to make adjustment under this article , and unless there be such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .
in any event , article 255 do not , at first sight , allow work to be do on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
do not the council have s representative think that this make it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
mrs frahm , the question that you raise be extremely important and we discuss it at great length during the last intergovernmental conference .
i would like to say that transparency do not only apply from the community institution " outwards " , it also apply between the institution .
as a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue be raise and discuss on several occasion .
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference .
the matter be still open .
i believe that the commission have s proposal should make provision for great transparency in term of the way the various institution function , but i think that there be always room for improvement in this matter .
for our part , we be prepare to study any proposal made in this area .
it be a very important question indeed which jona sjöstedt and others have ask .
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which strengthen democracy and ensure that there be a worthwhile dialogue between citizen , decision maker and authority .
we be very anxious indeed that the eu , too , should move in this direction , and this be also state in the treaty of amsterdam .
one or two year ago , parliament adopt a report by mrs lööw which be extremely important in this context .
the report warn that the forthcoming process would lead to restriction upon the transparency of the member state .
we can now see that there be perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament .
i want to ask the council if it understand this warning , in view of what we have now see in the working document from the commission .
i listen very carefully to what mr seixas da costa have to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference .
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference , which would mean widen the agenda .
mr dimitrakopoulo , transparency be naturally a issue of concern to the institution .
it be obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the european agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference .
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
as far as we be concern , they will be .
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
question no 5 by ( h-0785 / 99 ) :
do the council believe that it be permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violate the originally establish tac of 33 000 metric tonne per year , give the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stock ?
what measure do the council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stock , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
the council be aware of the critical level of anchovy stock in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refer .
it be also stipulate that this would be revise in the light of new scientific information on preserve species , of which we hope to see example in the first six month of this year .
as for the southern stock of anchovy in ice zone ix , the tac be fix at 10 000 tonne for the whole of 2000 as oppose to 13 000 tonne in 1999 .
fishing quota transfer between portugal and france be reduce proportionally from 5 008 tonne in 1999 to 3 000 tonne in 2000 , for fishing in french water .
i would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stock overall , over the whole community fishing area .
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stock of anchovy in the bay of biscay be allocate to spain and only 10 % to france .
without this transfer from portuguese water , the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiply by ten in order to grant adequate catch to france .
that be why i think that this be quite positive from portugal have s point of view .
this situation would obviously be even more damage to the level of stock than the risk refer to by mr ortuondo larrea , which we also understand .
mr president-in-office of the council , i must say that your comment have not satisfy me at all .
i understand that portugal be affect by this .
today , scientific study show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay be in danger of extinction , and now there will be measure to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fish in that bay .
the court also state that the principle of relative stability have not be violate since the anchovy quota allocate to spain in zone viii have be maintain at 90 % and france have s at 10 % .
accordingly , mr ortuondo larrea , the council reiterate its opinion that without this transfer , great account would be take of france have s possibility for anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay .
the council therefore reiterate its opinion that fishing pressure would be great and more damage to population number than the solution which be eventually choose .
in concrete term , 3 000 tonne represent 57.5 % of portugal have s fishing opportunity in 2000 against 5 008 tonne or 73.9 % in 1999 .
question no 6 by ( h-0788 / 99 ) :
in the light of the above , will the council reconsider the fund for the reconstruction of kosovo , as request by parliament ?
what other practical measure will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?
mr alavano , i would like to say that i have the great sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raise .
the council have always stress the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrate such act and of those who continue to perpetrate such act .
it will not be tolerate , and must stop immediately .
it have be communicate explicitly and repeatedly to kosovar leader that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-albanian minority be treat .
i think that this be a extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlie the european union have s position , be being maintain by the council and will continue to be maintain .
we have fully support the effort of the unite nation mission and the international security force in kosovo to prevent further outbreak of violence against minority and to protect the population under threat .
kfor and the unmic police consider one of their two main task to be prevent any form of maltreatment on the ground of a person have s ethnic origin .
i would like to thank mr president-in-office of the council .
i believe - as i think we all do - that portugal , its former president , mr soare , and its government , maintain a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombing in the balkans .
today have s political statement on this issue be very positive indeed , and one which i welcome .
however , there be some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intention express by the european union .
unfortunately , we have recently witness the eradication of serb , romany , turkish , and croatian minority in kosovo and we be now wonder what will happen next .
mr alavano , i cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on mr kouchner have s responsibility , and i would like to make two very important point here .
the structure being implement in kosovo be under the auspices of the unite nation .
it be a structure to which the european union have give as much support as it can and to which the country of the european union have contribute in various way .
therefore , the responsibility of the european union have to be see in a certain context .
these be question which we should all be ask , but the forum for putt these question be the unite nation .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structure , in the aim of improve the credibility of the authority .
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
we have endeavour to provide material help .
we have try to defend peace by taking military action .
what be the situation now as regard effort to include psychological criterion in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
mr rübig , as i said , i understand your concern very well .
the issue which we should all raise , and i do so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concern the very substance of security council resolution 12 / 99 .
i know that this be a extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chance of being implemented. we advocate that it should be implement in its entirety .
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency .
mr seixas da costa , i totally agree with you .
the problem be not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he be working , namely resolution 1244 .
it be the failure to define this scenario which be cause or encourage the excess , accident and assassination mention by mr alavano .
do the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo ?
since the author be not present , question no 7 lapse .
question no 8 by ( h-0796 / 99 ) :
however , housing be specifically exclude .
through the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund , the eaggf , this community support framework be design to help reverse the trend of abandon rural area , a issue you be quite right to raise .
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the erdf also contribute to promote sustainable rural development and to create sustainable employment in rural area .
question no 9 by ( h-0798 / 99 ) :
the portuguese presidency also attach importance to reinforce food safety policy and i think that the portuguese foreign minister and president-in-office already refer to this aspect this morning .
we think that the role of food safety , specifically in term of everything link to public health , be one of our presidency have s essential task .
it be therefore one of the priority of our programme .
this be what we shall be trying to achieve during the portuguese presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our effort to this house .
i thank the president-in-office for his reply .
i completely understand your concern , and i feel that there be a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue .
we also have to think of the consequence , especially in term of finance and compensate farmer .
nevertheless , as you know , this issue be now in the hand of the european commission and it will have to take this further .
the council have s ability to intervene in this matter be strictly limit .
mr president , i too would like to welcome the president-in-office to the chamber .
i feel this be one area where europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the member state .
mr president-in-office of the council , you have talk a lot about the future , about what the commission will do , and what the presidency will do in lisbon , etc .
however , you also said something which i find particularly frightening .
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
i be beginning to feel a little worry because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .
i do not see how you could , with the view that you hold , provide any answer .
i would like a answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intend to do something about these matter .
you must understand that a presidency have s ability to reverse global social or economic trend during its six month in office be actually quite limit .
i think that it be also obvious that our ability to act be link to the commission have s own scope for intervene , through its right of initiative .
one of them be the series of measure which must be adopt immediately in order to deal with the specific effect of social exclusion .
the second be to create internationally competitive condition , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the european union , and this will have positive knock-on effect on the problem of social exclusion .
the portuguese presidency do not have a magic wand with which it can , in six month , resolve problem that have always exist .
it be prepare to act on proposal by the commission in any area for which there be community competence .
we will try to move these strategy forward as much as possible during our presidency .
question no 12 by ( h-0801 / 99 ) :
subject : portuguese presidency and development policy will the president-in-office of the council make a statement on the priority of the portuguese presidency with regard to development policy , the convention of lomé and tackle famine situation ?
i would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the minister who spoke to the committee on development last week in brussels outline the position .
but there be some question still outstanding .
there do not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aid in the programme .
the situation of aid in africa now be so serious that more people be dying of aid than be dying in conflict .
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
medicine be available in the unite state but the unite state be not making them cheap enough for the people in africa .
at the same time , there be a war going on between eritrea and ethiopia and the armament industry in europe be not short in send gun , after which we will send the bread .
first of all , mr andrew , you must understand that i do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague have s speech during the meeting of the committee on development .
there be no contradiction between our two position , quite the opposite .
as you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
all we would have to do be get a directory of development and put all the item in our programme , one after the other .
we must understand that there be limitation on what we can achieve , particularly in term of managing national indicative programme .
indeed , in term of development aid policy , i think that europe have absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compare very favourably with that of the unite state .
be the council aware of the social problem cause by the export of food by the eu to develop country at price below the cost of production ?
do the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
since the author be not present , question no 13 lapse .
i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council , and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency .
please allow me to remark on how well-verse and well-informed he be on european affair .
unfortunately , in my case , he do not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer .
since the council recognis the fact that culture be a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
saying that the cultural dimension be govern by the principle of subsidiarity and that it be therefore national government who be responsible be , i be afraid , just a excuse .
this be a true example of the council have s indifference towards culture , despite its assurance to the contrary that it be a matter to which it attach great importance .
i would therefore like to ask the council if it be prepare henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it support banana , hop , cow and indian hemp .
mr marino , we be not adopt a purely economic approach to managing the portuguese presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension be , i be sure you will appreciate , one of our main concern .
this be , and will continue to be , connect with development within the world trade organisation .
but , mr marino , in the eu context , culture be a issue which be repeatedly raise in connection with igc agenda .
of course , if consensus could be reach on this issue at the intergovernmental conference , there might eventually be progress .
it remains to be see whether or not there be a consensus on this .
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestion on this issue .
mr president , i join others in wish portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
i notice that you said this particular issue be not currently on your agenda for the next igc but if some people wish it , you would consider it .
well , i , and my fellow 35 british conservative mep wish it and would like you to please consider it .
i appreciate that it be a provocative question .
it be meant to provoke because there be a very serious issue here that some country do not hold eu law in the respect which it deserve .
we have to find some way of putt pressure on such country to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizen .
i cannot think of a better way to do it .
can you ?
the issue be whether the european dimension will become strong or weak as a result of being specifically integrate into the treaty .
intergovernmental conference be a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree .
it be therefore not out of the question that these issue , which crop up again and again , and which be pass from one conference to another , may be address .
mr dimitrakopoulo have the floor for a procedural motion .
i would ask him to be brief .
mr president , i understand that i have to do this very quickly .
i like what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas .
in spain they say a letter to the three king .
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament have already sent a letter to the three king through its report .
now the presidency and the council have to bring the present which we have ask them for in our letter to the three king .
as i suspect , it be not exactly a procedural motion , but more a close of the debate .
we thank mr seixas da costa , but he can also write his letter to the three king .
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulo have raise be a extremely important one .
the problem be that in this case father christmas have to follow order and therefore he can only give present when he be authorise by others to do so .
it be not the portuguese presidency have s job to hand out the present that everyone want , especially those that the european parliament be ask for .
after this interesting exchange of opinion , and in accordance with the rule of procedure , i would like to tell you that question no 17 to 27 will be reply to in writing .
that conclude question to the council .
capital tax
the next item be the joint debate on :
the oral question ( b5-0004 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the council , on the council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question ( b5-0005 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the commission , on the commission position on the idea of a capital tax .
the bulk of these financial transaction be purely speculative and do not involve any trade in good or investment .
yet the erratic movement of these massive sum of capital can , in a few hour , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunging its whole population into recession .
in view of this situation , renew interest have be express in the proposal by jame tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transaction .
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there be both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .
many personality and institution have come out in favour of this tax such as the brazilian president , fernando cardoso , the finnish government , the canadian parliament last march and also lionel jospin in 1995 .
this question have be debate in several national parliament of the eu .
i be delight with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reach with the gue / ngl , green / efa , eldr and pse group .
one of the most common objection be that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be said of any tax .
if this argument have be accept in the past , then no tax would ever have be create .
the motion also ask that a position document , draw up by the commission and council , should be submit before the next annual meeting of the imf .
the european union must take the initiative and must also , as demand in the motion , propose this initiative to the g7 because it be primarily a political question .
madam president , i do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
the council have not yet discuss the possibility of introduce a tax on movement of capital as professor tobin suggest .
as it fall to the commission to propose any such initiative , the council have not yet be able to adopt a position on this issue .
madam president , the revenue basis of the tobin tax be said to be made up of very short-term exchange transaction .
such transaction , accord to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variable .
this have also just be underline by mr désir .
taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial stream , even a low nominal tobin tax would yield respectable sum of tax revenue .
in reality , the motive underlying the increase interest in the tobin tax and other source of international finance in the mid-ninety be non-economic .
indeed , it be fuell by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programme at a time when demand for such fund be rise quickly and fund be increasingly hard to come by .
the commission recently observe renew interest in a global tax , such as the tobin tax , as a mean of achieve socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .
mr désir too have mention this growing interest on all side .
but if the tobin tax be to be apply unilaterally in order to prevent attack on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .
put more strongly , in the long term it be possible that for large number of fund , the tobin tax will be evade by shift foreign exchange rate transaction to off-shore tax haven .
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there be a sufficient number of industrialise country which be prepare to participate .
for the reason set out above , i cannot see a good reason for introduce a european tobin tax .
at any rate , the commission be against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union .
in more direct term , to the extent that this measure could be deem a indirect restriction on capital stream , this would contravene the treaty of rome .
madam president , commissioner , i should like once again to say a few word on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .
also because i know how many social democrat in this house share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy expert .
we know what the problem be : instability on the market as the result of speculation .
but the people ask the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the commissioner have just so impressively told us , be the result of speculation .
the tobin tax would not have be able to prevent the crisis in the eea in 1992 and 1993 or the crisis in the south-east asian currency in 1997 .
in my view , and i say this quite clearly , the question be ideologically motivate rather than solution-focus .
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reason .
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?
first , and the commissioner have also confirm this , because it place a heavy burden on the capital market .
even a small tax would have serious repercussion on the capital market , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investment considerably .
secondly , speculative capital be extremely difficult to identify .
thirdly , unless they be introduce in all country at the same time , tax measure be easy to circumvent because there be otherwise too many loophole .
fourthly , technically speak , this measure be highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .
the measure which we should be taking be part of the resolution before us here today .
we need strong banking supervision .
we need to clarify the liability for transaction .
we need a framework of regulation at international level .
we need to examine national law in order to check that they comply with the rule of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rule can be step up .
i have a serious problem with one of the central point of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stand .
i refer to point 9 .
have listen to the commissioner just now , we know that the commission have s knowledge of the fact will result in a have no have to the tobin tax .
the capital market do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which be why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .
madam president , the debate on a tax on short-term financial action be not a new one .
we have be discuss the tobin tax proposal for twenty year and yet the question be still topical because we need really concrete and honest answer base on careful study .
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transaction really be .
we must ask what instrument we can use in order to create the order here which have be missing in the past .
it be therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulation and about transparency on the financial market and their information .
it be important that we know who the actor be and what their credit rating be .
we must also ask if there be not a need for fiscal justice .
this be the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedure of report from committee and plenary debate in order to reach a balance and really forward-looking proposal .
i will have to repeat these argument , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue have arise once again .
firstly , there be no evidence that the tax on international capital movement could reduce the danger of volatility and instability in the international market .
furthermore , the idea of obtain resource to apply them to the more economically needy country present such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appear simply impossible .
this be a false debate whose aim be purely political , and have no basis or technical viability .
i suppose that the first thing they say will be , have let us see whether you be capable of reach a fiscal agreement within the union have .
in itself , globalisation be positive .
the economy have never grown so much nor favour so many country on a global level .
this be due to progressive opening up and great freedom in the international trade in good and service and also a great capacity for adequate movement of capital .
any analysis of economic development in recent year , if objective , will show , through the figure , that they have no political colour or orientation .
as i have said , we be not oppose to such a study .
madam president , commissioner , the problem do not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .
the main objective of this debate be to look at the instrument available to the international community for stabilise the international financial and monetary system .
in this respect , mr bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separate from the issue of the tobin tax .
secondly , the motion do not say that we want a solely european initiative .
there should be no confusion in this debate. as environmentalist , we do not want a excuse for a motion .
although a study produce by the commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
this argument be therefore not relevant .
i will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone have their argument .
however , i would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .
we clearly expect a political stance to be take with a very firm deadline of the preparation for the autumn session of the international monetary fund .
we therefore demand , if this motion be adopt tomorrow , that the commission and council appear before parliament to tell us what position they will take on this occasion .
obviously we all have different approach which be demonstrate by our debate and the motion for a resolution table at the beginning .
have said this , our group be please about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. this invite the commission to present a report within six month .
us 1 800 billion be the volume of money move every day in the world have s currency markets. this represent over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in good and service .
by putt finance at the helm , this have reinforce the demand of profitability and toughen the operating condition everywhere .
it have led to a growth in merger , acquisition and company restructure and to gigantic sum being raise with increasing frequency on the financial market .
unemployment and pressure on employee worldwide be increasing .
opening and real growth be being hamper and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital be threaten the economy of many country , to the point of collapse , as in asia , russia and brazil .
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation pose by the lack of nearly one billion job and the need to make unprecedented effort in term of development and access to information .
in this respect , all idea deserve to be consider , including the tobin tax which be important , just like other form of transaction which may be envisage .
this tax could help to check speculation without penalise the activity of the real economy .
the commissioner have said that a minimum number of industrialise country would be need to achieve this .
in any case , the european parliament would be honour to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .
madam president , i too be delight that we be have this debate. i only regret that it have be so long in coming .
our world be now dominate by a single logic or , i could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .
it be natural that these élite would exclude any political concern from their field of manoeuvre , thus protect themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible .
yet they reckon without the salutary reaction of the nobody , both individual and state .
this be because it would basically mean that politics be regain a foothold in a area from which it have be exclude by operator whose profit be proportional to the degree of resignation of state .
if the world have s other important currency trade area be to be exclude from the tobin tax , the fact that tax be liable to be paid in europe would lead to currency deal moving to those area .
this have already be made clear a number time in this debate .
it be not enough that all the world have s industrialise country should be include in the scheme , as then currency trade would move to tax haven outside that group of country .
there should therefore be a universal application : it be not enough that the g7 country or the other industrialise country be involve .
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regard how the tax revenue would be distribute .
with regard to the tobin tax as a mean of prevent future currency crisis , it have to be realise that the cause of a currency being overvalue cannot be avert through taxation .
for that reason , as mr kara also said , we should give more attention to the policy that lead to a certain currency being overvalue in relation to its actual potential value .
this again would require measure to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policy in this way .
although it seem a reasonable scheme , the tobin tax be not without its problem , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which i do not believe there will .
it have to be remember that money at present be first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
for that reason , the uninterrupted flow of asset in massive volume between the world have s financial centre be not merely speculative activity , which have nothing to do with the real economy .
hence , as mr kara have state to his credit , our group be resolutely oppose to the introduction of the tobin tax .
madam president , i speak as someone who be in support of a tax on speculative capital movement across currency border .
it seem to me blindingly self-evident that some action be necessary .
the size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange market have made it hard and hard to manage national and regional economy .
computer-controlled sell programme turn a random blip into a avalanche , bury job , live and industry across the globe .
mr chirac have describe those who engage in this as the aid virus of the world economy .
what be necessary be to throw some sand into the wheel of the currency speculator , stockbroker and option trader .
of course , this cannot be do in one country ; it cannot be do within the single currency area , but it could be do at international level with global cooperation .
europe , japan and the us - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
i be disappoint in the epp .
i thought at least they read the resolution they be going to vote on .
yes , i be in favour of such a tax , but it be not what we be going to vote on tomorrow .
what we be going to vote on tomorrow be to ask the commission to study the matter , to look at what step and what condition would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
there be nothing so close as a close mind .
the tax have the support of 47 % of the people in the uk , accord to a recent survey by war on want .
in france it have have enormous resonance , particularly when link to a demand to use the proceed to help the third world out of its debt and poverty .
this issue can no longer be ignore by parliament , the council or the commission .
there be now a weight of public opinion demanding a answer more sophisticate than : " it have not be do before " .
madam president , commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flow would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rule .
i have two or three point to make in this respect .
one of the main demand of the demonstrator in seattle be , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this be not by chance .
the proposal of this tax today send out a strong signal from the rich european country prove that they want to move away from the culture of egoism .
everyone feel that this kind of joint tax be a virtuous measure which do not prevent trade but be aim primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. the member on the right should note this .
it symbolis the need for solidarity with the country of the south , particularly those in africa , the caribbean and the pacific which question us extensively on this subject in seattle .
in order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply release by such a tax must be redistribute among the poor country .
this be how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rule and show solidarity with the people of the south .
we cannot maintain a situation in which investment and the creation of job be less lucrative than short-term sale of foreign currency and share .
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activity increase more and more quickly .
it have be demonstrate in germany that income from monetary asset have almost double from 7.6 % of overall economic income since tobin develop his idea .
we cannot maintain a situation in which the poor country of the world be most expose to the speculative argument surrounding short-term currency fluctuation .
nor do i believe that this be impracticable .
why should it not be possible for the g7 country , the other eu member state , china , singapore and switzerland to come to a agreement on the introduction of the tobin tax ?
there must be a overriding economic interest .
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiate , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transaction , all the so-called cash transaction , currency future and option ?
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which do not jeopardise the long-term investment need by the economy but which finally make short-term and speculative investment unattractive .
madam president , we be not ask for more bureaucracy , as mr kara put it just a few minute ago .
we be look for solution .
of course capital market need clarity - that be actually the idea .
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .
he recognise that the combine impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the european union be construction be intimately link to a huge amount of new regulation .
we citizen of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .
to continue would be economic suicide .
honourable member , commissioner , it be often said that europe have succeed in stabilise the economic sector , but this be only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .
the fact that the public accept such rate and do not just abandon all financial activity in a panic can be explain by overambitious expectation over future gain .
speculative activity be growing beyond measure and be , in turn , generate profit which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious .
over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .
the danger be too great for us to ignore .
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
modern economic science have provide a exceptional instrument with the tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .
that be what we be lack , commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackle speculation .
madam president , mr bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate be unbelievable .
we need a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax mean .
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
that the right oppose tax be quite understandable , except that they should never have be allow to spirit their million , or rather billion , into switzerland .
we all know that !
but now i call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transaction and undermine long-term project with long-term capital .
it have never be do in south-east asia , it have never be do in europe , and i can understand why mr kara from austria have left the chamber , give austria have s financial record .
they be all tar with the same dirty brush !
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
madam president , i be totally appall by the commission have s , i.e. mr bolkestein have s , political ignorance !
he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he be here at all !
madam president , i too have found part of the debate quite bizarre .
those who own the monetary asset be currently amass huge fortune which be again screaming out to be reinvest .
we have asset inflation of global proportion .
as a result , speculative bubble continually arise on the financial market , cause growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardise the entire economy .
and it be precisely the medium-sized undertaking and large number of employee who suffer as a result .
we can take action against this ; it be possible .
the minimum requirement for this would be for a proper study to be carry out at long last , not only by the commission , but by reputable economic institute throughout europe .
that too be feasible .
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandy about argument which be ask for trouble !
it be not correct that the tobin tax be technically impracticable - it be quite feasible in the age of the computer .
the fact that tax haven be frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large european bank here at home must not be ignore .
madam president , let us indeed tax money speculation : it do not produce anything new .
the tax would be target at the right place : at the speculator .
who be going to defend these speculator , when nurse and teacher be paying top rate of tax ?
article 73 c of the treaty establish the european union provide scope for taxation on transaction .
those who oppose taxation on currency deal be in favour of those tax-recycling centre , the tax haven , of which there be 62 in all .
the union should make a tax pact , which any country could initially be party to .
the low rate tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problem .
it be strange to claim that if everyone be not include it would be impossible to bring into effect .
the european union be found through the effort of just a few country , and you see how we be today .
the truth be the great problem be a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .
in the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
lady and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world have s speculative elite have on planning the world have s economy by remaining outside the tax system .
madam president , may i begin by extend a heartfelt thanks to all speaker and , above all of course , mr désir , for the fact that this debate be taking place this evening .
whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it be evident that it be a important one .
this be why it have be around for year , and it be satisfying that the commission be being afford the opportunity this evening to give a response .
i would like to start by underline two remark made by the member of your parliament , mr gasòliba .
he said that globalisation be a positive phenomenon , and i share his view .
a second remark made by mr gasòliba be that there be currently no evidence that the tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rate .
i think that he be correct in this regard .
i too be not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transaction would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rate .
i be of the opinion that these be two important remark , and that be why i be reiterate them here .
madam president , could i furthermore point out that none of the speaker this evening have draw a link between the tobin tax on the one hand and the function of the european union on the other ?
surely we be all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedom be the freedom of capital movement .
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i be , in other word , oppose to all measure which hamper international financial transaction .
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .
madam president , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observation , there be also practical objection to the tobin tax , as already underline by mr kara and other speaker .
it have unfortunately be observe , i have to say , that the european union have fail to reach agreement internally on specific tax measure .
this indicate how difficult these dossier be .
if we have not be able to reach agreement internally , i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partner .
i think that this will be problematic .
madam president , mr jonckheer have state that this could be one of the measure for stabilise the financial market .
in order to remove these cause , one have to look at what be happening in the country in question .
be it the case that these country can boast of what be term in english have good governance have ?
be it the case that there be low inflation and that there be low interest rate ?
that the market for production factor , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?
that be not always the case .
so if we want to look into what cause exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the element of good governance and focus on these first .
in addition - and this have also be mention already , for example by mr gasòliba i böhm , but also by others - there be a need for more supervision .
more supervision nationally - supervision by national government of national bank - and internationally , for example by mean of the imf .
madam president , accord to various member of your parliament , more fund should still be made available for major project .
for example , mr kreissl-dörfler spoke in english about have long-term capital for long-term project have - this be a obvious issue .
madam president , i should like to leave it here .
i have receive four motion for a resolution , table pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rule of procedure .
madam president , unfortunately i do not have your mastery of the french language .
but i would be oblige if mr bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which i think he cannot do at the same time as talk to mrs randzio-plath .
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him ?
monsieur bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque choose !
unfortunately , my dutch be not as good as yours .
but i would rather like to say something else to you .
parliament be not taking the initiative and support a tobin type tax just to annoy the commission .
we want to examine the possibility of introduce a tobin tax .
it will be just one of several instrument and hopefully you will be on our side in this .
from a political point of view , i always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these thing !
it be not your job , it be our job to decide on that .
it also have something to do with the newly awake self-consciousness of this parliament .
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
we can do so without going off at other tangents. i respect you as a serious commissioner who want to take his work seriously .
please respect us as member of parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that include the tobin tax !
madam president , a omission appear to have be made .
mr désir , i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
if the service of the presidency confirm that this be correctly table , it will be include .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12.00 p.m.
( the sitting be close at 8.14 p.m. )
adoption of the minute of the previous sitting
mr president , i simply want to pass on some news. there be a terrorist attack this morning in madrid .
someone plant a car bomb and one person have die .
on behalf of my group , i once again condemn these terrorist act .
thank you , mrs fraga estévez .
we have heard about this regrettable incident .
unfortunately , the terrorist murderer be once again punish spanish society. i note your comment with particular keenness , as you may expect , give that i too be spanish .
( the minute be approve )
resumption of the session
i declare resume the session of the european parliament adjourn on friday , 21 january 2000 .
madam president , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the cermi tragedy .
mrs angelilli , thank you. i have take note of your comment .
agenda
the next item be the order of business .
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduce by speech from mr seixas da costa , president-in-office of the council , and mr romano prodi , president of the commission .
be there anyone who wish to speak in favour of this proposal ?
madam president , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which be more in accordance with rule 50 of our rule of procedure .
this debate be topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amend to include it .
( applause )
be there anyone who wish to speak against this proposal ?
if you ratify ...
mr gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rule of procedure be observe .
madam president , i thought i have three minute .
do forgive me .
topical and urgent debate
the next item be the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance .
talk in austria on form a government
the next item be the debate on the talk in austria on form a government .
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa , president-in-office of the council .
madam president , president of the commission , president-in-office of the council , the group of the party of european socialist hope that this debate will send three message to the european public .
let it be note that we be completely unite on all three count .
in any event , these common value be in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically know as the austrian freedom party .
i will say one thing. for many year i be a traitor to my country ; at least that be general franco have s view .
president guterre be also a traitor in salazar have s eye , and that be something that i believe should also be state and defend by the ppe-de .
i also believe that the commission , or president prodi , have act as a guardian of the treaty .
however , i would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he describe the commission as a european government .
a government must have more nerve and more courage .
that be what i be ask president prodi for at this moment .
( applause )
secondly , madam president , we wish to send a very clear message to the austrian people .
we should not be so politically partisan .
the accession of austria to the community be a joint venture .
we all take part in it , not just one group .
i therefore think that this be a great day for european politics to commence .
we support the council and we believe that it be our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .
( applause from the pse group )
madam president , my group welcome this debate because it be a define moment .
this be the first time in the history of the modern european project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstream of a party of the extreme right .
that be deeply disturbing .
the fpö contend that if one read their literature and their programme , there be much in it that one could share .
that may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we liberal democrat have with the austrian fpö in our liberal international family .
as early as 1986 , we have cause to believe that mr jörg haider be not a man whose principle or attitude be consistent with decency and modern liberalism .
in november of 1991 , after a long internal debate in liberal international and many visit to vienna to discuss issue , we suspend the fpö from membership and in july 1993 we expel them .
we expel them then and we continue to reject what mr haider stand for now .
let me share what we learned in that long experience .
there be many in our rank who said " read the text " .
there be many more in our rank who said " read the subtext " , " look at the context " .
word in politics can be incendiary , can be inflammatory , or can be conciliatory .
we found that mr jörg haider , as a wordsmith , have be a voice for racism and for xenophobia .
he be a man who play on fear and who have exploit vulnerability .
that be why this debate be important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism , something profound be happening in europe today .
( applause )
i hasten to add that our quarrel be not with the austrian people .
we respect the right of the austrian people to their own democratic process .
every right-thinking person in this house believe that these be universal and indivisible without regard to colour , class or creed .
we must promote and defend those right , all the while saying to the people of austria : our quarrel be not with you .
i wish to say with regard to the initiative of the portuguese presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it .
it may not be a ideal initiative in term of its structure but we accept mr president-in-office , that it be root in idealism and for that reason we be incline to support it .
i share with president prodi a preference for the community method and we must look at article 6 and article 7 of the treaty .
article 7 talk about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breach of our fundamental value .
we must find a way as institution to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it have a reality and a substance .
then we can work together by the community method to root out this cancer within our midst .
i want to say madame president some word to mr schüssel .
mr schüssel be a man with a honourable record in european politics .
he now intend to ride into government on the back of a political tiger .
mr schüssel - you be assume a very serious , personal , national and european responsibility .
that responsibility , which you mr schüssel now take on , be to respect the letter and the spirit of the european treaty .
finally , madame president , this be a debate which touch on the heart of our democratic value and institution and call to mind that the price of liberty be eternal vigilance .
it be a dogged insistence by the democratically elect part of the institution of this union that we will not as european countenance turning the clock back .
( loud applause )
madam president , in my group have s opinion , the european union today face a political and ethical challenge which be without precedent since the creation of the union .
the european union have certainly previously know situation where there be people in a member state government whose idea and action be in contradiction to the guide value of the union .
however , with haider and his man , we would see the extreme right , openly racist , anti-semitic and xenophobic , promote to the rank of co-ruler of our community .
going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testify , albeit unwillingly , to the respectability of a political force which be not respectable .
of course , there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of austria .
any action which can be take must , in our opinion , serve the twofold function of proscribe haider without , however , isolate austrian society .
democrat in this country now need our support more than ever .
the great join of force in protest in vienna on 12 november last year must now undergo development suit to the new situation .
we must have dialogue with them and join force with them , stand at their side in order to offer the people of austria some alternative prospect .
finally , we must ask ourselves : how do we come to be in this position ?
this debate be now before us , but each and every one of us , male and female , be going to assume their responsibility without delay .
( applause )
madam president , we could have be debate the need to reinforce the found principle of the union , so that we can uphold them together .
instead , we have be force to debate the formal , substantial error that have be made in the last few day .
we have never before see such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affair of a member state .
however , up till now , austria have commit no serious or persistent violation .
apart from amount to interference , the statement by the presidency be discriminatory because it authorise the penalisation of a population and deny these people their right to choose who to vote for .
sanction can be impose after the treaty have be violate , but cannot be apply if a democratically elect party enter government .
bilateral relation involve the state , so the 14 do not come into this .
so many thing set us apart from mr haider - as we have often write - including his claim to the completely italian alto adige region .
however , we already know this .
however , today we be concern to learn that other representative of the union seem to have turn their back on the union have s democratic role .
we support legality and democracy as express by the people , and favour uphold national sovereignty as long as this do not violate the principle of the treaty or human right .
we believe in europe , while it seem that others have start the process of break up the union .
this be what have come of rush headlong into enlargement and not clearly define role and task .
we have built a europe with a unstable market , not a europe with principle , right and politics .
and these be the consequence !
madam president , today we have a appointment with hypocrisy .
in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria .
there be risk , as we be all aware , but in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
we could , if one third of the member of parliament so request , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .
( the president cut the speaker off )
madame president , my group , the edd , and especially my party , be very concern by this debate .
we cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiment and politics of herr haider and we deplore his reference to the third reich .
we also , however , deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfere in the policy of a elect government of any country , especially one which be part of the european union .
my party at home be certainly not racist , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well .
be you going to interfere with great britain have s parliament if we be elect ?
madame president , the people of austria have speak by elect herr haider to their parliament .
i believe they give him 28 % of the vote so there be going to be a coalition government .
your parliament , may i suggest , madame president , should wait to see if the party of haider have a effect on the policy of that country .
then , and only then , might you consider if human right be affect .
your parliament may consider measure appropriate to counter that situation and then , madame president and only then , may your parliament consider interfere in the constitutional affair of a country of the european union .
madam president , to begin with , i would like to make one thing abundantly clear : austria be not in danger of experience a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion .
austria be a stable democracy ; one in which human right and fundamental freedom be guarantee under the constitution and be afford the protection of a independent judiciary .
austria be a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .
there will be a function majority and likewise a function opposition .
we respect and accept the discussion that be taking place and also appreciate the concern that be being voice in many of our member state as to the way ahead for austria .
our understanding spring from the knowledge that our history of the recent past have bequeath to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .
our country be not just the first victim of the hitle dictatorship , many people be perpetrator too , although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt .
the övp play no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union .
my country have s place be not outside the european union but in it ...
... , with all the right and commitment that this entail !
any future government must therefore be judge accord to the value and principle it profess to in its manifesto , and not accord to the prejudgement put about both by political adversary and the international media .
my party can be rely upon to see to it that my country hold firm to the course of european politics and continue to be root in the european community of value !
( applause )
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , representative of the commission , it be a black day for austria and for europe .
not even mr sichrovsky have s web of lie or mrs stenzel have s word of appeasement can do anything to change that .
for the day have dawn : two irresponsible politician , consume with a lust for power , be sell austria have s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interest , down the river !
( applause , heckle )
they be trade this in for a head of government have s position and for membership of a government .
however , my criticism - and i freely admit this - my rage , be direct exclusively against those who have provoke these reaction and continue to do so , messr schüssel and haider and their party , ...
... and that include their representative in this parliament .
the argument that mr poetter himself use have come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his mystique if he be to be integrate into the political system .
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrate into this , into our political system , and into the europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .
( applause )
this historic weight of guilt fall on the shoulder of the conservative for have consort with the wolf of their own free will and wait to be devour .
that be how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the övp - be sustain rather than kept in check .
i understand that europe and the civilise world want to have as little as possible to do with such a government .
however , by the same token , there be another austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrate against the fpö have any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria !
( applause )
the more powerful this europe become and the more vigilant it be towards authoritarian tendency in the europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the root of right-wing extremism .
for europe be and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism .
please support the austrian people against this government !
( applause )
madam president , this be a historic moment , as it be now , at last , quite clear to us all that the european union have gradually develop into a community of value .
we see this , now that the government of one member state be being join by a party which , as be know , do not respect all these value .
as member of parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begin to establish fundamental right be more important than ever .
it must not be allow to remain a mere declaration .
as important be the fact that austria have s force of democracy should be give support , as none of us wish to isolate the country .
we know that most austrian respect these value .
they have also show how they feel : not all the demonstration have take place outside austria .
doubtless there be also a lot of protest voter on the scene that have want a change in austrian policy for a long time .
i believe parliament should support these force of democracy .
i also appeal to the austrian president , that he might yet look into all the possibility for form a government made up of democratic force .
madam president , i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , francis wurtz , remind us of just now .
i welcome the statement by the presidency of the council and the position of the 14 country which have reject official contact with a austrian government that include jörg haider have s party .
this danger do not concern austria , it concern europe .
we be talk about us , not austria .
not only the alpine region , but all our country be involve : the condition be being create whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat .
the position take by the presidency have show that it be aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
europe be showing that it have not forget auschwitz ; europe be coming face to face with the suffering of the past .
this be the change we must impose on the commission have s action .
madam president , we be debate a extremely serious issue .
we be debate nothing less than the presence in a member state have s government of a political force whose doctrine and principle be incompatible with the conceptual and moral base of the union enshrine in its found treaty .
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the austrian freedom party have s manifesto be enough to make any democratic conscience shudder .
of course austria be a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affair of a member state .
however , that be not the problem .
the question be whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which include such a party .
our answer to this crucial question be no .
( applause )
konrad adenauer once said - and he know what he be saying - that the sure way to pacify a tiger be to allow it to devour you .
history be a compendium of event which could have be avoid .
( loud applause )
madam president , the european union be built upon the idea have never again have , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camp , anti-semitism , heighten nationalism or war .
it be not true to say that , when a government form a alliance with neo-fascist somewhere in europe , this be merely a question of national sovereignty .
for this union of ours be not a grouping of neighbouring nation state who be simply coming to mutual arrangement to improve their collective circumstance .
let us learn the lesson of the past .
they put their own petty squabble first , and the rest be history .
we must make a rapid , strong and unite response .
i would have like to hear your discussion with the austrian president , mr poetter .
we be well aware that he be very embarrass today at the dirty deal that government have do in form such a alliance .
so our response must be rapid and strong .
of course , the treaty provide us with a barrier when thing become intolerable ; i be almost going to say have irreparable have .
and when that day come , it be too late .
we must therefore find a political solution .
our response must be rapid .
if today we do not staunchly support the council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieve the political equivalent of the munich agreement .
today , we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which be important to all nation within europe and to anyone who feel particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
madam president , this debate be open by mr da costa , who merely confirm that the eu presidency be trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member state .
this debate , and the background to it , reinforce the point that the council , the commission and this parliament itself be dominate by socialist .
my delegation of 37 conservative and unionist member from the unite kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of austria have s freedom party .
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular world war ii , but also its policy on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the european union itself .
we be also outrage , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excess of the former ussr .
even today , surely it be high time for the party of european socialist to break their fraternal link with china have s communist party .
this , madam president , be the hypocrisy of the left .
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standard , especially of the british government and the other largely socialist head of eu government and include that of the unite state .
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produce uncomfortable result .
this require action to address the underlying cause , including a examination of the electoral process itself .
that should be our task , not political posture .
madam president , representative of the council , commissioner , a week ago , the big international holocaust conference end in stockholm .
its aim be to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today have s society which take the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism .
secondly , i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluation .
we demand of the candidate state and of the country with which the eu cooperate under the lomé agreement that they should respect human right and show tolerance towards their neighbour .
we must do the same as far as we ourselves be concern .
that be why we be react against this carry-on in austria .
it be not acceptable to continue as if nothing have happen .
we be at a watershed in the history of the european union .
the union be not only a economic community but also a community of value , something which we take seriously. something have happen .
the european union be in the process of finding its soul and get some steel in its spine .
madam president , as everyone have said , this be a very important day .
it be the day of the first debate of european political life .
and this be not pure chance .
i feel that today have s meeting be not a meeting of europe , our institution , with austria or mr haider have s party .
it be the meeting of europe with itself , with its raison d have être , with the reason why we be here in this chamber .
this chamber be not made for good , it be not made for money .
this chamber , and the european institution , be build to uphold value , morality and a certain spirit .
the fact be that it be enough to read the manifesto of mr haider have s party , the fpö , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .
reading only one sentence which my friend , mr vidal-quadras , have previously mention , " the nation be define by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . "
well , we cannot accept such statement .
( applause )
madam president , we the belgian christian democrat be concern as , fortunately , be a great many other member too .
the coalition which be being create in one of the member state be clearly a austrian affair but undoubtedly have a european dimension too .
because what be it that unite us in europe ?
surely it be the value and principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right , more than anything .
the austrian freedom party leader , mr haider , have repeatedly repudiate these value .
he also repudiate the basic form of diplomatic politeness .
he be a dangerous man .
the christian democratic party in my country have made up their mind a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protest of extreme-right voter but never to negotiate with extreme-right leader .
value should take precedence over power .
we deplore , therefore , what be happening in austria .
in fact , we be shake by it .
we be extremely disappoint .
as a last resort , we would ask the övp to look into alternative .
we keep remind them about article 6 of the treaty .
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .
if , despite this , the coalition go ahead , we would urge the övp party member to ensure that the principle and value which underlie european integration be observe in political programme , both in word and deed .
madam president , austria await a heavy responsibility .
have you stop to ask what kind of effect the debate we be have here and the statement deliver by the council presidency last weekend be have in austria itself ?
have you stop to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfold from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?
have you stop to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep be to be fulfill and election be to be held in austria in the course of the next few day ?
from all account , this would only serve to strengthen haider .
who would want this to happen ?
be it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
europe be a community of law .
democracy , respect for human right and rule of law be amongst the principle that we must uphold .
it be for reason of constitutionality that the president-in-office of the council ought not to have made the statement he do , and in a manner that go against the treaty .
( applause )
i be duty- bound to say to this house , there be no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offer , or indeed the action take , by the commission on this issue .
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as do the president this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrate by fourteen member state in their statement on monday .
secondly , we said , in very specific term , that we will work closely with all member state in examine the situation as it develop in austria .
there be no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , franz fischler .
that surely be in everyone have s interest .
in order to ensure that the treaty be upheld and that we sustain what be describe as the community machine , we be following the course of action which be set down in our statement yesterday .
we will continue to do that , madam president , without fear or favour .
that be our duty .
it be also a matter of conviction .
my final point be this. we understand the context of this essential debate .
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he have of nazism .
and , when we recall that , like many others on all side of this house , my and my colleague have instinct be naturally arouse .
however , the commission have to act on the basis of value and law and not only on the basis of instinct .
and that be why we come to the conclusion we reach yesterday morning. that be why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the value and the law .
without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people .
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as mr cox said in the debate , have necessarily with acute vigilance have .
do the commission support the council ?
thank you , commissioner kinnock .
i think that we have just have a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expect of it .
thank you , lady and gentlemen .
the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
recourse to the precautionary principle
the next item be the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .
i want to start by saying that i be please to be present this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it have be write together with david byrne and erkki liikanen .
the precautionary principle be not a new concept .
it also appear in a range of international text , for example , the rio declaration and most recently the bio-safety protocol .
the essence of the precautionary principle be clear .
however , the use of the precautionary principle have be increasingly in the spotlight in recent year .
event such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulate a growing public debate about the circumstance in which precautionary action be justify and necessary .
in view of this growing interest , the commission therefore consider that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .
the basic aim of the communication be twofold .
the commission have s start point in apply the precautionary principle be the need to ensure a high level of protection in the field of environmental , human , animal and plant health .
of course , this objective cannot be use to justify irrational or arbitrary measure , but it do mean that action can still be take even in situation where the science be unclear .
as such , while the precautionary principle do not involve the politicisation of science , as some have allege , it do take us to the crossroads between science and politics .
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depend largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-maker be prepare to accept for society .
it be therefore political by nature .
however , the measure that may subsequently be take must obviously comply with the general principle applicable to risk management and the guideline for apply the precautionary principle be therefore the key element of the paper .
measure take must be proportional to the choose level of protection - that be , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .
they must be non-discriminatory in their application , that be measure should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .
and they must be consistent with similar measure already take .
for example , if one product have be approve , similar product should also be approve .
all these element have to apply cumulatively .
it be also important to bear in mind that there be a wide range of measure , which can be take in apply the precautionary principle .
for example , a research programme , public information campaign , recommendation and so on .
apply the precautionary principle do not , therefore , automatically imply a ban .
this communication do not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it be the first time that the commission have present a structure presentation of the principle and its operational use .
mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
i have three short question , the first being as follow .
we have be await a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it be anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speak with one voice .
do the document you have present here today also accord with the opinion of your colleague the commissioner for industry , foreign trade , competition and the internal market ?
i be sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen be also aware as to what the consequence of this will be ?
my next question , mrs wallström , be when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemical or other sector , for example ?
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle have be apply in legislation ?
in other word , will each proposal contain a additional sheet state that check have be made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion have be reach ?
. thank you very much , dagmar roth-behrendt , for these question .
of course , this be share by the whole commission .
this be a common communication which be write by the three of us , david byrne , erkki liikanen and myself , but it have be pass unanimously in the commission today .
it receive strong support from the rest of the commissioner and it have be through a interservice consultation in the whole of the commission .
so we have really work through this document and i be sure that they be all able to describe the guideline and the principle as laid down in this document .
yes , i would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issue like a new chemical strategy for example .
and , i be sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
we have just recently have a case of use the precautionary principle when it come to ban phthalate in soft pvc toy ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental area .
it have be mainly use in the environmental field , but , of course also when it come to human health .
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
needless to say , this accord science a great deal of power .
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientist will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?
the communication also state that the precautionary principle can be apply , provide there be a sufficient recognise minority of scientist .
i would like to ask , what be , then , the definition of a recognise minority ?
how would you describe this ?
what establish a recognise minority ?
if a political decision be involve , i would also like to ask : who take this political decision ?
the commission ?
the council ?
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this ?
what be the role of the scientific committee ?
what , also , will be the role of the food authority which you be about to set up ?
finally , will this whole decision-making process be carry out in a transparent , public way ?
these be my three question .
. yes , mr president , that be true .
there be many and difficult issue and not always crystal clear , but i will try to answer some question .
who will take the decision , who be the decision-maker ?
well , that depend on who the legislator be .
this be part of risk management .
they have to look at , for example , the concern of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what be know about the scientific evidence in a certain case .
however , it be true that it do not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .
it can be use on evidence from a minority or where science be incomplete .
that be , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .
it be not always easy to describe exactly how this process be do , but there be no question of changing the scientific base .
we use the expert to get as much scientific information and fact as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be do in the future .
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that be available .
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
so , there be no answer to all your question but this do not change the system of the scientist that we use today or the system of expert that we use today .
mr president , i have a question concerning a actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .
it be about brominate flame retardant .
it be a fact that these substance be now being discovered. there be increase concentration of them in both people and the environment .
there be many people who maintain that they entail major risk , while others question how large the risk involve in these substance really be .
recently , both sweden and denmark urge the commission in the council of minister to take the initiative and ban brominate flame retardant .
i be wonder , therefore , if you be prepare such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such a initiative .
.
( sv ) mr president , thank you very much , mr sjöstedt , for this question .
the issue of brominate flame retardant be a important one .
it be raise quite recently in the environment council by a number of minister who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be do .
we be in the process of look into this question and assess what knowledge we have today and what it be possible to do .
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle do not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .
there may be a series of different measure which can be take .
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpret as a ban .
where brominate flame retardant be concern , there may eventually be a ban , but it be important to say that the precautionary principle permit the whole spectrum of political measure and initiative to be take .
this issue be extremely topical .
the commission be to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with a assessment of what need to be do .
you said that the precautionary principle should not be use as a disguise trade barrier .
be the understanding of this point the same on both side of the atlantic ocean ?
i think we be going to have problem particularly with hormone-treat beef and genetically modify crop .
will the american take the same view of this point as we do ?
. ( sv ) mr president , i be please to be able to tell you that , in montreal , we have just sign a protocol concerning bio-safety .
we succeed there in agree , at a international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeed in conclude this protocol .
i believe it will set the trend for future discussion concerning the precautionary principle .
we be going to be able to use this as a example of how the precautionary principle be to be interpret .
it be , moreover , also accept as a important and effective tool .
mr president , i have two questions. i shall try to be very brief indeed .
the first question concern the implementation of the precautionary principle .
as i have understand it , there have be a certain lack of clarity in some respect as to how this be to be understand .
be it the case that a risk assessment be firstly to be carry out , including a cost-benefit analysis ?
my second question concern the burden of proof .
i remember marget wallström being introduce as commissioner in the committee .
at that time , she be talk about the desire for a reverse burden of proof .
in other word , a product have s manufacturer be to demonstrate whether or not the product be hazardous .
i want to know whether this also apply in the document which the commission have present now .
. ( sv ) thank you , mrs schörl .
these be two important question , and it be good that i should be give the opportunity to clarify them .
no , one must not begin by carry out a cost-benefit analysis .
it be not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .
the second question concern the reverse burden of proof .
it be perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain case .
i have use chemical strategy as a good example of a area in which we need to do this .
it be , however , perfectly correct that , when it come , for example , to chemical , we must ensure that we obtain a reverse burden of proof .
mr president , i believe that the precautionary principle need to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confuse by all the different interpretation possible .
i will give a example : a fungicide have be prove to cause baby to be born blind. it be therefore a teratogenic substance .
very well , it be a fungicide , it kill off mould .
this teratogenicity have be demonstrate by just one english laboratory , perhaps because it be the only one that have carry out test .
so i want to put this question to you .
when human health be at stake , or there be the possibility that human health will be seriously affect , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ?
the cost of a baby being born blind be too high ; there be no benefit that can compensate for this .
naturally , it be not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be a enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure be avoid .
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .
in those circumstance , consideration should be give to what be likely to produce the best result .
i cannot forbear telling you about a occasion when the expression cost-effective be use by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine use it , namely when i be on a visit to africa .
at a hospice for aid patient , i met two irish catholic nun who be care for dying aid patient .
i believe we can learn something from this .
we must , of course , always ensure that we use our resource in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broad possible help .
as be also explain in the present communication , it be not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis .
consideration should be give to what science be offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be use as a important political tool for protect the environment and people have s health .
mr president , it be a rare honour to be give a second opportunity to ask question !
commissioner , i would like to come back again to my first question , when i ask about the other commissioner , for it may have sound as though i be in jest .
indeed you respond in kind , as i know you would do .
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill ask , that be to the connection we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union .
i have good reason for ask this .
as you rightly said , the precautionary principle be need in precisely those area where , as yet , there be no scientific evidence .
that be exactly what it be all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talk about the precautionary principle here , commissioner !
i be certain that we be going to have more conflict , for example with the unite state .
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .
ever since we sign this protocol in montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition write into a protocol deal with the environment , health and trade .
this constitute a good example , therefore .
we should be in no doubt that conflict may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .
we now have a number of guideline for use the precautionary principle , and we have increase support among our respective people for use it , something which be clearly establish in the present communication .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate be close .
intergovernmental conference
mr president , i will begin by thank the portuguese presidency and the commission for all our recent very useful contact .
let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration .
the intergovernmental conference that be about to begin be important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method base on which europe will be function in the twentieth century .
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieve that reform be the agenda base on which the intergovernmental conference be to begin its work .
this be because the helsinki agenda be limit to consideration only of the three issue that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the european union have s institutional body .
i will not repeat which one , because everyone know .
grant this , the new intergovernmental conference must not fail to include in its agenda issue which , properly address , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the european union have s institution .
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issue which , for that very reason , be highly visible to the european public .
in its numerous debate and its report so far the european parliament have openly support the convene of the intergovernmental conference .
all the same , whether or not more issue will be consider must in no way diminish the importance attribute by every member state to the intergovernmental conference .
mr president , the group of the european people have s party be not satisfy with the conclusion of the european council in helsinki .
it seem to us that the agenda lack content , because our group be thinking in term of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union have s institution .
the european council in helsinki itself approve enlargement involve 13 new member state .
it be therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiation with 13 country while contemplate a minimal reform .
we be therefore thinking in term of the treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a deep reform of the union .
have said this , mr president , this parliament be holding this debate today because we do not want to delay the start of the conference .
in theory , we could have do so .
we could have vote on the 17th of this month and the conference would not have be able to start on the 14th .
mr president , i be very happy to be able to say this to the portuguese presidency because it have earn great respect in this assembly .
mr president , i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament be not a aspiration to gain benefit for the european parliament itself .
however , the european parliament will be reinforce politically by the treaty result from this intergovernmental conference .
it be already establish within the community acquis that those legislative issue which be decide by a qualify majority be also subject to codecision with parliament .
therefore , since the qualify majority will be extend , there will also be more codecision with parliament .
however , this parliament would not be fulfill its role as a supranational european institution if it do not consider the political design of the union .
that it be what we be doing .
we believe that , in the political design of the union , other issue need to be dealt with .
these include , amongst others , the incorporation into the treaty of security and defence issue , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporate into the treaty .
of course there be also the charter of fundamental right , and work begin on its wording yesterday , which i believe have start very positively .
we be going to work seriously to ensure that the european come to see being european as a advantage and that european citizen have certain fundamental right which be connect to the union have s institution .
we will talk about this on another day .
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the group of the european people have s party , mr president , be ready to give that green light .
mr president , for the socialist group i can say we will be support the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteur on behalf of the constitutional affair committee .
the amsterdam leftover be not a very good term , because they be very important subject in themselves .
let us call them the first three subject of the igc .
these first three subject be very important but they be subject which be explore in detail by our member state during the last igc .
they do not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine month of further study .
they need a political deal .
it be more a question of nine minute , perhaps nine hour if it be difficult , lock away together in a room to reach a solution on these subject , not nine month .
in those circumstance it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
there be other issue that should fruitfully be look at , especially before such a large widen of the union to so many new country .
nobody be ask for a christmas tree .
nobody be ask for a igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subject being debate .
however , there be six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subject which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
there be time .
remember the igc that led to the single european act .
it last only five month .
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty last a year .
a year be ample time to address a large number of issue and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial point that we wish to be add to the agenda .
i be please to see that the commission share our view .
the commission have just publish its opinion and it have do exactly what parliament ask of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty article .
i thank the commission for doing that even if , of course , i do not agree with everything the commission said .
i think there be some gap in what they have put forward .
nonetheless the commission have provide a service and i pay tribute to commissioner barny who be here with us today for doing that .
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issue that we be going to have to address in this igc .
that be all to the good .
the parliament , the council presidency and the commission be pull in the same direction for a wide agenda .
we should no longer be worry that the agenda for the igc will be restrict .
that be one of the political conclusion that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 member state yesterday virtually to freeze relation with a partner .
it make it impossible for those same member state , at the igc , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental right .
my group strongly welcome the igc and will be contribute to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
moreover , give that this opinion be quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be vote for it .
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it be quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .
the event in austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in europe and we need to establish principle which provide base all the member state .
how , though , be the union to be enlarge if we do not do the job properly now , i.e. before enlargement take place ?
that be why we as a group be in favour of the intergovernmental conference .
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently need and hope that it actually come up with the good that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future .
my group , mr president-in-office of the council , note with satisfaction that the council presidency be far from happy with the current state of affair .
you can therefore rest assure that the confederal group of the european unite left / nordic green left be commit to seeing that the union get on with the task in hand .
the politics of close door and private discussion ; all that must be consign to the past once and for all .
that be why we need transparency .
in this way , europe would truly belong to the citizen and the union would acquire a entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .
there be another central issue relate to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .
after all , what will the citizen say if we make a solemn announcement about right to them but they be unable to take legal action in respect of these right as individual ?
no , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the union .
the poor turnout at the european election really should have be warning enough for everyone .
what we need be visible right for each and every citizen ; the charter of fundamental right must be made legally binding for all the citizen of the union .
of course , we be also talk about effectiveness of decision and function institution in a union of 27 plus member state .
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a minus reform , as the council have resolve to do , and that be why all institution must come under scrutiny .
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the great possible attention to equal right for the major and small state .
this be something i would stress , particularly with my being a mep for one of the major member state .
there be one final issue i would like to raise .
parliament have s opinion expressly demand amendment to the treaty in the area of economic policy .
it be indeed the case that globalisation of national economy , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associate stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making process .
what we need most of all be to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union have s policy to date .
it be all about create a socially just europe .
a socially just europe be still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority be place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the union have s policy .
it must be adhere to in the interest of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .
our group have therefore table a raft of amendment which , when take together , form a real alternative resolution .
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decision-making system that pay great attention to national sovereignty .
the federalist imagine that they be thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this be a totally superficial concept .
quite the opposite , in a enlarge europe , mr president , the standardisation impose by the improper use of majority decision can lead only to the whole thing explode .
the europe which result from this be not strong but weak , as it no longer know what it be or what it be defend .
we be delight today to see the progress this idea have enjoy in certain circle , one which be still , unfortunately , outside the european parliament and the commission .
a flexible europe , be a europe which respect its national democracy , which rely on the support of its nation , its national patriotism , instead of continually persecute them .
it be this that give us the determination to defend ourselves against external threat , not the constrain , convoluted decision making procedure which the commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .
mr president , i be speak on behalf of the italian radical and i would like to say to the president of the council that he have see what parliament have s opinion be .
this be the message that parliament be send to the council .
i hope that the portuguese presidency - and i add my compliment to those already offer - can convey parliament have s message and convey the result of our mediation work on saint valentine have s day .
in any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the igc agenda .
this message must be very clear ; this be how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
we shall give a opinion - which be technically and legally necessary - on convene the igc on 14 february , but we shall give a unfavourable opinion of its content .
there be clearly a more ambitious goal .
mr president , the president of the commission be not being quite honest when he talk last week about the intergovernmental conference .
these be matter which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voter and no longer be able to change on election day .
brussels know best .
mr prodi also announce great transparency , but his draft regulation signal a clear backward step , and that be not only my assessment , but also that of the european ombudsman .
there be also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away document of a kind which be at present publicly available in a range of member state .
under the banner of " progress towards transparency " , a range of document be being lock away from the general public .
it be , of course , thoroughly orwellian .
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which be not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .
in addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiation and of the institution , which may be use for any purpose whatsoever. it be therefore ...
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , lady and gentlemen , the portuguese council presidency have s account have give me the distinct impression that we be approach this intergovernmental conference with well-consider idea and a high degree of openness .
we as a european parliament will use these opportunity to see that our issue be give the attention they deserve .
the preparation the commission have made so far be on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the european parliament have s motion be anything to go by .
there be more to be said on that score .
it be crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
in the end , it be only by have these three thing in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizen .
at the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the european union .
if we have be have a different debate here in this chamber today then that only go to show how important this be .
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government elect to impose a total blockade .
this be a important sign that majority vote be a crucial pre-requisite to the european union have s being able to function come what may .
this be particularly important where enlargement be concern , and legislation and in relation to treaty , which entail change being made to legislation .
of course we also want to extend the european parliament have s corresponding power in this area .
in addition , we as a european parliament be going to have to take action in relation to economic and monetary union , for there be a lack of supervision in this area .
the finance minister behave as if they be in a intergovernmental meeting , when in the ecofin council and in the euro 11 council , which be a unacceptable way to go on .
unlike mrs kaufmann , i be not in favour of extend supervision over the european central bank as i be a advocate of independence for the european central bank .
however , there must be a appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
the overall plan fail to do justice to any of this .
we must examine whether any change be need to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference .
the portuguese presidency have agree to initiate deliberation on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .
there be another point i would just like to draw your attention to .
the european union need few , if any , new instrument , and it do not need any new competence .
what it do need be instrument that will enable it to put its competence into practice .
for this reason , we must ensure that the instrument have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizen , the task we have already formally be set in the treaty .
in my view , that be the most important issue this intergovernmental conference have to concentrate its energy on .
if we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarge the european union .
this be the crux of the matter .
mr president-in-office of the council , i be confident that this will be tackle in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage .
you spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital city and told us about the difficulty that some government have in reach a consensus in their own country , and therefore in their parliament .
i would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we have a very worthwhile day of discussion and dialogue with the representative of the 15 national parliament , which be represent by competent and exacting delegation .
the aim be not to draw conclusion - it be impossible to draw any - but the debate be certainly very encourage .
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliament for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference .
yesterday , we also discuss the commission , represent by commissioner barny , who give its opinion .
this effort be appreciate , even if different view be later express as regard the proposal , and moreover , mr president-in-office , you also express different view .
we be count on the portuguese presidency , we be count on ourselves and we be count on the commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debate on all of this at the intergovernmental conference .
mr president , only a strengthen europe can cope with enlargement .
only a strengthen europe be immune to political opportunist who exploit dissatisfaction .
that be why sweeping reform be necessary and , hence , a widen igc agenda .
the finnish presidency only listen to minimalist government and , unfortunately , turn a deaf ear to this parliament .
portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor have s book .
it be of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join force for this igc .
in many way , they share the same interest and the same insight .
a essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this parliament have s right of assent to the forthcoming change to the treaty .
of all priority , this one be the most pressing .
what be the commission have s verdict on this ?
there be no reason whatsoever why representative directly elect by citizen should be involve in talk at a lower level than the commission .
not only do we owe the sweeping reform to the new member state , but we owe them to ourselves .
if we allow europe to be water down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .
mr president , there be day when i really cannot understand this parliament. it seem to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation .
after have restrict , on its own initiative , its participation in the igc to two minor seat , parliament be now give up the right to add to the agenda for this igc .
a good dose of hypocrisy be need to overlook our weakness today .
if there be a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political group which so want this haste will be accountable for this .
because of the situation in austria , this be a dark day for europe .
it make us realise that the victory of democracy be never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .
in order to assert our fundamental value , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this igc , i believe we owe europe a constitution .
mr president , the draft resolution we be now discuss require , precisely as before , that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should have a broad agenda involve radical reform of the institution .
the forthcoming enlargement of the union be use as a argument for this .
i be convince that this be a error of judgement .
a federal and centralist eu which intervene more and more in the government of the member state be in actual fact less well place for enlargement .
a flexible eu which concentrate on few but important area and which respect national difference and national democracy have a better chance of embrace a significantly great number of country .
paragraph d of the draft resolution require a more coordinate and more open economic policy at eu level .
it be not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talk about monetary union .
this text say nothing about the major democratic and political problem involve monetary union and the european central bank. this be untenable .
if there be a desire to make the eu more democratic , the whole construction of emu must be reconsider .
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the stability pact must be re-examine and discard so that we might have a uniform policy which have prosperity as its primary objective .
article 56 of the treaty , prohibit currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be remove so that damage currency speculation may be check by mean of political control .
in the majority of eu country , there be now government dominate by social democrat .
it be remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them be demanding any change in the direction take by monetary union .
it also , of course , damage credibility when it be state that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalise capital .
the resolution require the european parliament to have increase influence over the intergovernmental conference .
it be , however , important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference be and will remain a conference of the member state .
it be the member state have parliament , or people vote in referendum , who be to direct the development of the treaty .
it be therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be give any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
nevertheless , the event of the last few day show that all those who have made basic criticism of the way enlargement and the revision of the treaty have be plan be right .
this be what be and be meant by the call for a european constitution .
and it be not a question of link with the past ; it be a question of prospect for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divide stand on this .
they rightly include the problem with monetary union and centralist government and present a number of alternative democratic principle .
however , that be precisely what be happening .
you can think what you like about mr haider , and i personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in a independent and friendly country have s democratic process .
i welcome commissioner barny and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon .
on 14 february , we will see the launch of the igc which be to be complete by the end of 2000 .
this be a big task but it can be do .
i think it be generally agree here this afternoon across all group that the helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare europe for enlargement .
in other word we need to go further than what have be refer to as the important " amsterdam leftover " .
in relation to the latter point , ireland want to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal member of the commission irrespective of the number of member state join .
we be prepare to consider re-weight the vote in the council of minister , provide that the large member state be willing to agree to every member state have a full and equal member of the commission .
i feel i speak for many small country when i make that particular point .
at the igc , we would also need a debate on the possible division of the treaty into two - into a policy area and a area on the constitution .
we would accept the division of the treaty providing it would not limit the control the small member state have in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the treaty .
in other word , if we be not represent fully in the commission we will not have a input into policy discussion .
so we be watch that entire point extremely carefully .
we look forward to the charter of fundamental right and to seeing its content .
the treaty of amsterdam , mr president , have set the number of european parliament member at 700 and a debate be need in this parliament on how that number will be distribute among the enlarge europe .
in any case , this emerge from the favourable schedule we decide upon .
i think that , under the present rule of the treaty , the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .
on the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposal on the necessary reform , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposal be worthy of note .
we must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliament .
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reform .
they must therefore realise that such issue cannot be decide on the rationale of bargain alone .
the issue to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference be exceptionally sensitive .
it may be easy to come up with solution , but what matter be how well those solution will stand up in the long term .
i will mention two point that may create tension .
one be the balance which have so far be maintain between large and small country .
europe be not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
the solution we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the european union , which be a union of state and people .
the other area of conflict be more difficult .
owing to the imminent increase in membership , the body of the future european union must become more effective .
this mean that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
by its very nature , however , the european union be , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution .
possibility for fast and more simple operation do exist .
of course they do , but they be not unlimited .
if the limit be exceed because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer .
i be , however , optimistic .
mr president , the intergovernmental conference mandate need to be widen .
the most important issue with regard to this be internal differentiation within the union .
the commission have s former president , jacque delor , have once again publicly raise the issue of a european confederation .
he have also said that the country in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed fast and that they should have their own institution , for the sake of clarity .
the commission have s current president , mr prodi , and the high representative , mr solana , have put forward idea along the same line .
last november , the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party adopt a position on internal differentiation within the union when it propose a system of concentric ring for europe : the onion skin model .
in the next resolution on the igc , parliament must take a long and hard look at the question of differentiation and flexibility .
both enlargement and the achievement of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric ring , as propose by the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party .
my colleague , mrs frassoni and mr onesta have already speak , somewhat sceptically , about some aspect of the matter in hand .
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between union and member state but between member state and their own internally self-governing region .
this have be give inadequate attention and there be many thing to be concern about .
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implication of enlargement in respect of this parliament .
a ceiling of 700 have be prescribe as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .
scotland , with a population of 5 million , have eight seat in this house at the moment ; denmark and finland , with the same population , have sixteen .
what will happen to a place like scotland , which i represent here ?
it will become totally invisible !
a growing body of opinion in scotland hold that view .
mr president , to say that the european union be at a crossroads be no doubt nothing new. it have be said many time .
this time , however , it be true .
we have establish the single currency - which be extremely positive - and we be facing enlargement .
the question be if we will undertake enlargement whether we be prepare or not .
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?
that be the debate , and this question must be address in any discussion of the intergovernmental conference , its agenda or its method .
it be clear that the council , for the moment , have not opt for enlarge with deep reform in place .
that put enlargement in danger .
it jeopardise any prospect of political union and , of course , it be difficult for the public to understand .
the council must realise that , if we want the future of the european union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundation , the next intergovernmental conference must go much further .
the council be consult us and parliament be give its opinion .
we want a intergovernmental conference , but not this one .
must there be a igc ?
of course there must , but not this type of intergovernmental conference .
the agenda must go much further. we must be much more daring with regard to the issue dealt with in the igc and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
being much more democratic mean great participation by the european parliament and allow the commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .
we must clearly set firm objective .
the functionalist approach be over , for better or for worse .
the functionalist approach have brought us to this point .
have we achieve result ?
we know , i know myself , that the week we have before us will be useful to us .
i would just like to make a few comment , after reading the draft opinion and after listen to the speaker on behalf of the various group .
firstly , lady and gentlemen , the commission understand the anxiety express by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .
indeed , it be in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the commission frame for its own opinion , but use all the term thereof , plus everything between the line .
we have not restrict ourselves to the three so-called leftover , which be , in any case , a incorrect label .
i do not like the term have leftover have any more than richard corbett do .
they be the first but they be not the only subject , mr seguro , that the conference must deal with .
however , these council proceedings must be carefully prepare .
throughout this conference , lady and gentlemen , it be not only the status of the negotiator which be important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
i be sure that in this way the european parliament will not be just a observer at these negotiation any more than the commission will be .
we now await , therefore , with great interest , lady and gentlemen of the house , your next opinion , in which you will specify parliament have s priority and practical proposal for these negotiation .
quite probably , our point of view and our position will not always be the same .
there will probably be difference of opinion , that would be only normal .
the important thing be that we be consistent , and i have be commit to working towards this consistency ever since i accept the position of commissioner .
our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subject , be to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiation forward successfully .
finally , i should like to make three additional comment , quite briefly , mr president .
such dialogue between the national parliament , the european parliament and ourselves be extremely important .
i have said , furthermore , that i would play my part by visit each of the national parliament .
tomorrow , i shall be in london. in a fortnight have s time , i shall be in berlin .
in three week have time , i shall be in paris , and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .
i feel this initiative you have take be extremely positive , and i should like to thank you for taking it .
my second brief comment be to thank the portuguese presidency , particularly mr seixas da costa , for his proactive approach .
indeed , the comment which have just be made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the portuguese presidency cannot be just a interim presidency .
it will have to initiate these negotiation .
not only that a conclusion can be reach , but that a successful conclusion can be reach , which be not necessarily the same thing .
conclude negotiation be not the same as conclude them successfully .
it be all the work which be going to be carry out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few month , which be extremely important .
after have heard prime minister guterre , the minister of foreign affair and yourself , i have confidence in the ambition of the portuguese presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiation .
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few month .
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topic of these negotiation .
these be difficult subject , subject relate to institutional policy and mechanism which be not always easy to explain .
all the more reason for member of the european parliament , minister , commissioner to devote a little time to explain matter to the citizen , to public debate .
as far as the commission be concern , it will , lady and gentlemen , be taking initiative to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate .
cross-border service
i would first like to say how indebted i be to the commission for seize the initiative , and for the two draft directive we be discuss here today .
these have , in fact , clarify that the freedom to provide service must allow for third-country national to be take on as employee of cross-border service and this without have to obtain work permit .
however , the european court of justice do not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirement and condition of residence and consequently the member state be unable to clarify this issue .
the situation as far as self-employed people be concern be that current community invest legal right do not afford third-country national the right to provide cross-border service .
there be no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
both draft directive seek to facilitate the freedom to provide service for eu enterprise .
it be not about establish original right for third-country national model on freedom of movement .
all provision , i.e. issue relate to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence right , should be regard as ancillary to this freedom to provide service .
consequently , i do not see that there be any real obstacle to the council have s being able to move matter on quickly as far as these two draft directive be concern .
i also believe that parliament have s propose amendment should make it easy for the council to adopt the directive as oppose to the commission have s proposal .
i be absolutely convince that it will be easy for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis .
this system appear to us to be unsuitable in practical term .
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence right should be clarify before the service provision card be issue , namely under the term of a opposition procedure .
i believe this system be also more suit to practical need .
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 month .
i would also just like to go into those of the propose amendment that go beyond the propose amendment put forward by the committee on legal affair and the internal market .
of course i would add that i continue to support this committee have s amendment , which they adopt unanimously .
i have even submit four amendment on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quote council decision .
two amendment be cancel by the service because the content have supposedly already be give consideration to in the report .
i withdraw the two other amendment - that be amendment no 18 to the report on self-employed person and amendment no 21 on employ person .
i can only urge the conference of president to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matter of comitology , i.e. the correct way to quote .
this would make our rapporteur have s life considerably easy in the future .
there be also a propose amendment to both of mrs de palacio have s report .
on a final note , i would like to thank all those in the committee who support me in compile these report , which be far from easy to produce .
that be why he deserve special mention !
may i say how the commission welcome the european parliament have s support for the two proposal on the freedom to provide service and on third-country employee , the topic of the debate .
i be extremely grateful for the work that mrs berger have put into these proposal which be politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .
i would also thank mrs palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the committee on legal affair and the internal market .
the commission particularly welcome the suggestion made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision card .
if the opportunity be create to apply for service provision card for one or more , or all , member state , the procedure would be more flexible still .
the commission also support the propose flexible period of validity of the card .
however , i do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that a employee be resident in a member state .
the commission also agree with a provision for case in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer be terminate at short notice .
a efficient procedure for issue card imply that company which provide cross-border service can also exercise their right in concrete term on the basis of the internal market .
it seem over the top to us for other member state to be give the option of systematically carry out inspection systematically with a view to safeguard public order before they issue card .
indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who have legal status in a member state to be admit to other member state too .
that do not prevent these member state from taking public-order measure within the framework of the propose duty of notification .
neither do the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three month after the card have expire .
following completion of the service , it be not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service be provide .
that be why the commission support mrs palacio have s amendment no 22 in both respect .
as far as the second proposal be concern , the commission appreciate the wish that it should be clear what be meant by someone who be self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amend proposal .
these be a few introductory remark concerning the key amendment .
i hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speaker have contribute , i will once again be give the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendment .
mr president , tomorrow will see a large majority within the ppe group vote in favour of the amendment put forward by the committee on legal affair and the internal market , as well as the amend version .
i propose to confine my comment to two area .
firstly there be the question as to what this directive be actually design to achieve , that be achieve in the real sense .
there be the fact that we have to take the interest of the economy and also of the individual into account .
my comment start from the premise that we be talk about a upright individual in gainful employment .
then there be the interest of the member state , which , being on the receive end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .
there be also a argument for introduce early notification obligation as well as have this card .
neither outcome would be satisfactory .
perhaps this be also why , as be rumour to be the case , the council have become bog down in its negotiation on this as well .
we have be trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easy possible solution .
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdle be create vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have be overcome , implementation be as easy as it possibly could be .
therefore we want application for the service provision card to be for one or more member state .
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdle that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
consequently , i too have to say that i be in favour of the amendment put forward by the committee on legal affair and the internal market .
perhaps there be a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the commission .
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
most of those who have be working on the directive to date have be lawyer .
we all know that there be still various part of the treaty , some of them very old , which be still refer to as ec .
we be aware that this directive be found on ec law and not on eu law .
however , before the election we - the council , the commission , parliament , the press , union and company that be - work towards making the europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizen .
we have expect the citizen to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu .
they have now got to grip with " eu " .
